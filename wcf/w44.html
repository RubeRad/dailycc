<p align="center"><a name="c27" title="c27"></a>Chapter 27: Of the Sacraments</p><p><a name="c27p1" title="c27p1"></a>1: Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM4:11,GEN17:7,10&version=47">[510]</a></sup>immediately instituted by God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT28:19,1CO11:23&version=47">[511]</a></sup> to represent Christ and His benefits; and to confirm our interest in Him:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO10:16,11:25-26,GAL3:27,3:17&version=47">[512]</a></sup> as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the Church and the rest of the world;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM15:8,EXO12:48,GEN34:14&version=47">[513]</a></sup> and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ, according to His Word.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM6:3-4,1CO10:16,21&version=47">[514]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c27p2" title="c27p2"></a>2: There is, in every sacrament, a spiritual relation, or sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN17:10,MAT26:27-28,TIT3:5&version=47">[515]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c27p3" title="c27p3"></a>3: The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither does the efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that does administer it:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM2:28-29,1PE3:21&version=47">[516]</a></sup> but upon the work of the Spirit,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT3:11,1CO12:13&version=47">[517]</a></sup> and the word of institution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT26:27-28,MAT28:19-20&version=47">[518]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c27p4" title="c27p4"></a>4: There are only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word lawfully ordained.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT28:19,1CO11:20,23,1CO4:1,HEB5:4&version=47">[519]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c27p5" title="c27p5"></a>5: The sacraments of the Old Testament in regard to the spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the new.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO10:1-4&version=47">[520]</a></sup></p>
