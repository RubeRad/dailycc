For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT25:31-46,ROM2:5-6,ROM9:22-23,MAT5:21,ACT3:19,2TH1:7-10&version=47">[576]</a></sup></p>
