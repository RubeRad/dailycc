<p><a name="c15p5" title="c15p5"></a>5: Man ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is every man's duty to endeavour to repent of his particular sins, particularly.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSA19:13,LUK19:8,1TI1:13,15&version=47">[300]</a></sup></p>
