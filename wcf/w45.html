<p><a name="c28p2" title="c28p2"></a>2: The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water, wherewith the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the Gospel, lawfully called thereunto.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT3:11,JOH1:33,MAT28:19-20&version=47">[529]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c28p3" title="c28p3"></a>3: Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but Baptism is rightly administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon the person.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB9:10,19-22,ACT2:41,16:33,MAR7:4&version=47">[530]</a></sup></p>
