<p class="Paragraph">III.     The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.<a id="_ftnref8" title="" name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[8]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">IV.     The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.<a id="_ftnref9" title="" name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[9]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">V.      We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture.<a id="_ftnref10" title="" name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[10]</span></a> And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<a id="_ftnref11" title="" name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[11]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">VI.     The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<a id="_ftnref12" title="" name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[12]</span></a> Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word:<a id="_ftnref13" title="" name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[13]</span></a> and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<a id="_ftnref14" title="" name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[14]</span></a></p>

<p class="Paragraph">VIII.  The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<a id="_ftnref17" title="" name="_ftnref17" href="#_ftn17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[17]</span></a> so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them.<a id="_ftnref18" title="" name="_ftnref18" href="#_ftn18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[18]</span></a> But, because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,<a id="_ftnref19" title="" name="_ftnref19" href="#_ftn19"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[19]</span></a> therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<a id="_ftnref20" title="" name="_ftnref20" href="#_ftn20"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[20]</span></a> that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner;<a id="_ftnref21" title="" name="_ftnref21" href="#_ftn21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[21]</span></a> and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.<a id="_ftnref22" title="" name="_ftnref22" href="#_ftn22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[22]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">IX.     The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.<a id="_ftnref23" title="" name="_ftnref23" href="#_ftn23"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[23]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">X.      The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.<a id="_ftnref24" title="" name="_ftnref24" href="#_ftn24"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[24]</span></a></p>

<p class="Paragraph">I.       Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace,<a id="_ftnref510" title="" name="_ftnref510" href="#_ftn510"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[510]</span></a>immediately instituted by God,<a id="_ftnref511" title="" name="_ftnref511" href="#_ftn511"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[511]</span></a> to represent Christ and His benefits; and to confirm our interest in Him:<a id="_ftnref512" title="" name="_ftnref512" href="#_ftn512"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[512]</span></a> as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the Church and the rest of the world;<a id="_ftnref513" title="" name="_ftnref513" href="#_ftn513"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[513]</span></a> and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ, according to His Word.<a id="_ftnref514" title="" name="_ftnref514" href="#_ftn514"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[514]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">II.      There is, in every sacrament, a spiritual relation, or sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.<a id="_ftnref515" title="" name="_ftnref515" href="#_ftn515"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[515]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">III.     The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither does the efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that does administer it:<a id="_ftnref516" title="" name="_ftnref516" href="#_ftn516"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[516]</span></a> but upon the work of the Spirit,<a id="_ftnref517" title="" name="_ftnref517" href="#_ftn517"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[517]</span></a> and the word of institution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.<a id="_ftnref518" title="" name="_ftnref518" href="#_ftn518"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[518]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">IV.     There are only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word lawfully ordained.<a id="_ftnref519" title="" name="_ftnref519" href="#_ftn519"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[519]</span></a></p>

<p class="Paragraph">I.       Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ,<a id="_ftnref521" title="" name="_ftnref521" href="#_ftn521"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[521]</span></a> not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible Church;<a id="_ftnref522" title="" name="_ftnref522" href="#_ftn522"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[522]</span></a> but also to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace,<a id="_ftnref523" title="" name="_ftnref523" href="#_ftn523"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[523]</span></a> of his ingrafting into Christ,<a id="_ftnref524" title="" name="_ftnref524" href="#_ftn524"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[524]</span></a> of regeneration,<a id="_ftnref525" title="" name="_ftnref525" href="#_ftn525"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[525]</span></a> of remission of sins,<a id="_ftnref526" title="" name="_ftnref526" href="#_ftn526"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[526]</span></a> and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in the newness of life.<a id="_ftnref527" title="" name="_ftnref527" href="#_ftn527"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[527]</span></a>Which sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in His Church until the end of the world.<a id="_ftnref528" title="" name="_ftnref528" href="#_ftn528"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[528]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">II.      The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water, wherewith the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the Gospel, lawfully called thereunto.<a id="_ftnref529" title="" name="_ftnref529" href="#_ftn529"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[529]</span></a></p>

<p class="Paragraph">V.      Although it is a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance,<a id="_ftnref533" title="" name="_ftnref533" href="#_ftn533"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[533]</span></a> yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated, or saved, without it:<a id="_ftnref534" title="" name="_ftnref534" href="#_ftn534"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[534]</span></a> or, that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.<a id="_ftnref535" title="" name="_ftnref535" href="#_ftn535"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[535]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">VI.     The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered;<a id="_ftnref536" title="" name="_ftnref536" href="#_ftn536"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[536]</span></a> yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongs unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in His appointed time.<a id="_ftnref537" title="" name="_ftnref537" href="#_ftn537"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[537]</span></a></p>

<p class="Center">Of the Lord's Supper</p>
<p class="Paragraph">I.       Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein He was betrayed, instituted the sacrament of His body and blood, called the Lord's Supper, to be observed in His Church, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His mystical body.<a id="_ftnref539" title="" name="_ftnref539" href="#_ftn539"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[539]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">II.      In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to His Father; nor any real sacrifice made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead;<a id="_ftnref540" title="" name="_ftnref540" href="#_ftn540"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[540]</span></a> but only a commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by Himself, upon the cross, once for all: and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God, for the same:<a id="_ftnref541" title="" name="_ftnref541" href="#_ftn541"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[541]</span></a> so that the popish sacrifice of the mass (as they call it) is most abominably injurious to Christ's one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of His elect.<a id="_ftnref542" title="" name="_ftnref542" href="#_ftn542"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[542]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">III.     The Lord Jesus has, in this ordinance, appointed His ministers to declare His word of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the communicants;<a id="_ftnref543" title="" name="_ftnref543" href="#_ftn543"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[543]</span></a> but to none who are not then present in the congregation.<a id="_ftnref544" title="" name="_ftnref544" href="#_ftn544"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[544]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">IV.     Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any other alone;<a id="_ftnref545" title="" name="_ftnref545" href="#_ftn545"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[545]</span></a> as likewise, the denial of the cup to the people,<a id="_ftnref546" title="" name="_ftnref546" href="#_ftn546"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[546]</span></a> worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about, for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.<a id="_ftnref547" title="" name="_ftnref547" href="#_ftn547"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[547]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">V.      The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to Him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ;<a id="_ftnref548" title="" name="_ftnref548" href="#_ftn548"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[548]</span></a> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<a id="_ftnref549" title="" name="_ftnref549" href="#_ftn549"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[549]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">VI.     That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense, and reason; overthrows the nature of the sacrament, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yes, of gross idolatries.<a id="_ftnref550" title="" name="_ftnref550" href="#_ftn550"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[550]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">VII.   Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements, in this sacrament,<a id="_ftnref551" title="" name="_ftnref551" href="#_ftn551"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[551]</span></a> do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally but spiritually, receive and feed upon, Christ crucified, and all benefits of His death: the body and blood of Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.<a id="_ftnref552" title="" name="_ftnref552" href="#_ftn552"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[552]</span></a></p>
<p class="Paragraph">VIII.  Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in this sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified thereby; but, by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,<a id="_ftnref553" title="" name="_ftnref553" href="#_ftn553"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[553]</span></a> or be admitted thereunto.<a id="_ftnref554" title="" name="_ftnref554" href="#_ftn554"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[554]</span></a></p>

<p class="Paragraph">III.     Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren, for deterring of others from the like offenses, for purging out of that leaven which might infect the whole lump, for vindicating the honor of Christ, and the holy profession of the Gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the Church, if they should suffer His covenant, and the seals thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.<a id="_ftnref557" title="" name="_ftnref557" href="#_ftn557"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[557]</span></a></p>
