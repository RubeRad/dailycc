<p align="center"><a name="c29" title="c29"></a>Chapter 29: Of the Lord's Supper</p><p><a name="c29p5" title="c29p5"></a>5: The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to Him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT26:26-28&version=47">[548]</a></sup> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:26-28,MAT26:29&version=47">[549]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p6" title="c29p6"></a>6: That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense, and reason; overthrows the nature of the sacrament, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yes, of gross idolatries.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT3:21,1CO11:24-26,LUK24:6,39&version=47">[550]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p7" title="c29p7"></a>7: Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements, in this sacrament,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:28&version=47">[551]</a></sup> do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally but spiritually, receive and feed upon, Christ crucified, and all benefits of His death: the body and blood of Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO10:16&version=47">[552]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p8" title="c29p8"></a>8: Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in this sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified thereby; but, by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:27-29,2CO6:14-16&version=47">[553]</a></sup> or be admitted thereunto.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO5:6-7,13,2TH3:6,14-15,MAT7:6&version=47">[554]</a></sup></p>
