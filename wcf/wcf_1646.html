<p><a name="c18p2" title="c18p2"></a>2: This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion grounded upon a fallible hope;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB6:11&version=47">[352]</a></sup> but an infallible assurance of faith founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB6:17-18&version=47">[353]</a></sup> the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2PE1:4-5,1JO2:3,3:14,2CO1:12&version=47">[354]</a></sup> the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM8:15-16&version=47">[355]</a></sup> which Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPH1:13-14,4:30,2CO1:21-22&version=47">[356]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="c29p5" title="c29p5"></a>5: The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to Him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT26:26-28&version=47">[548]</a></sup> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:26-28,MAT26:29&version=47">[549]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p6" title="c29p6"></a>6: That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense, and reason; overthrows the nature of the sacrament, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yes, of gross idolatries.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT3:21,1CO11:24-26,LUK24:6&version=47">[550]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="c29p8" title="c29p8"></a>8: Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in this sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified thereby; but, by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:27-29,2CO6:14-16&version=47">[553]</a></sup> or be admitted thereunto.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO5:6-7,2TH3:6,MAT7:6&version=47">[554]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="c30p3" title="c30p3"></a>3: Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren, for deterring of others from the like offenses, for purging out of that leaven which might infect the whole lump, for vindicating the honor of Christ, and the holy profession of the Gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the Church, if they should suffer His covenant, and the seals thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1TI5:20,MAT7:6,1TI1:20,1CO11:27-34&version=47">[557]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="c32p1" title="c32p1"></a>1: The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN3:19,ACT13:36&version=47">[565]</a></sup> but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUK23:43,ECC12:7&version=47">[566]</a></sup> the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB12:23,2CO5:1,PHI1:23,ACT3:21,EPH4:10&version=47">[567]</a></sup> And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUK16:23-24,ACT1:25,1PE3:19&version=47">[568]</a></sup> Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledges none.</p>
<p><a name="c32p2" title="c32p2"></a>2: At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1TH4:17,1CO15:51-52&version=47">[569]</a></sup> and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other (although with different qualities), which shall be united again to their souls forever.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOB19:26-27,1CO15:42-44&version=47">[570]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c32p3" title="c32p3"></a>3: The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonor: the bodies of the just, by His Spirit, unto honor; and be made conformable to His own glorious body.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT24:15,JOH5:28-29,1CO15:43,PHI3:21&version=47">[571]</a></sup></p>
<p align="center"><a name="c33" title="c33"></a>Chapter 33: Of the Last Judgment</p>
<p><a name="c33p1" title="c33p1"></a>1: God has appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT17:31&version=47">[572]</a></sup> to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH5:27&version=47">[573]</a></sup> In which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO6:3,2PE2:4&version=47">[574]</a></sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2CO5:10,ECC12:14,ROM2:16,14:10,MAT12:36-37&version=47">[575]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c33p2" title="c33p2"></a>2: The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of His mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of His justice, in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT25:31-46,ROM2:5-6,ROM9:22-23,MAT5:21,ACT3:19,2TH1:7-10&version=47">[576]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c33p3" title="c33p3"></a>3: As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2PE3:11,2CO5:10-11,2TH1:5-7,LUK21:7,ROM8:23-25&version=47">[577]</a></sup> so will He have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT24:36,MAR13:35-37,LUK12:35-36,REV22:20&version=47">[578]</a></sup></p>
