<p align="center"><a name="c26" title="c26"></a>Chapter 26: Of the Communion of Saints</p><p><a name="c26p1" title="c26p1"></a>1: All saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by His Spirit, and by faith, have fellowship with Him in His grace, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1JO1:3,EPH3:16-19,JOH1:16,EPH2:5-6,PHI3:10,ROM6:5-6,2TI2:12&version=47">[503]</a></sup> and, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each other's gifts and graces,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPH4:15-16,1CO12:7,1CO3:21-23,COL2:19&version=47">[504]</a></sup> and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1TH5:11,14,ROM1:11-12,14,1JO3:16-18,GAL6:10&version=47">[505]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c26p2" title="c26p2"></a>2: Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB10:24-25,ACT2:42,46,ISA2:3,1CO11:20&version=47">[506]</a></sup> as also in relieving each other in outward things, according to their several abilities and necessities. Which communion, as God offers opportunity, is to be extended unto all those who, in every place, call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT2:44-45,1JO3:17,ACT11:29-30&version=47">[507]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c26p3" title="c26p3"></a>3: This communion which the saints have with Christ, does not make them in any wise partakers of the substance of His Godhead; or to be equal with Christ in any respect: either of which to affirm is impious and blasphemous.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COL1:18-19,1CO8:6,ISA42:8,1TI6:15-16,PSA45:7,HEB1:8-9&version=47">[508]</a></sup> Nor does their communion one with another, as saints, take away, or infringe the title or propriety which each man has in his goods and possessions.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EXO20:15,EPH4:28,ACT5:4&version=47">[509]</a></sup></p>
