<p align="center"><a name="c29" title="c29"></a>Chapter 29: Of the Lord's Supper</p><p><a name="c29p1" title="c29p1"></a>1: Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein He was betrayed, instituted the sacrament of His body and blood, called the Lord's Supper, to be observed in His Church, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His mystical body.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:23-26,1CO10:16-17,21,1CO12:13&version=47">[539]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p2" title="c29p2"></a>2: In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to His Father; nor any real sacrifice made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB9:22,25-26,28&version=47">[540]</a></sup> but only a commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by Himself, upon the cross, once for all: and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God, for the same:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO11:24-26,MAT26:26-27&version=47">[541]</a></sup> so that the popish sacrifice of the mass (as they call it) is most abominably injurious to Christ's one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of His elect.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB7:23-24,27,10:11-12,14,18&version=47">[542]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p3" title="c29p3"></a>3: The Lord Jesus has, in this ordinance, appointed His ministers to declare His word of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the communicants;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT26:26-28,MAR14:22-24,LUK22:19-20,1CO11:23-26&version=47">[543]</a></sup> but to none who are not then present in the congregation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT20:7,1CO11:20&version=47">[544]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c29p4" title="c29p4"></a>4: Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any other alone;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO10:6&version=47">[545]</a></sup> as likewise, the denial of the cup to the people,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAR14:23,1CO11:25-29&version=47">[546]</a></sup> worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about, for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT15:9&version=47">[547]</a></sup></p>
