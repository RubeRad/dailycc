<p align="center"><a name="c33" title="c33"></a>Chapter 33: Of the Last Judgment</p><p><a name="c33p1" title="c33p1"></a>1: God has appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT17:31&version=47">[572]</a></sup> to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH5:27&version=47">[573]</a></sup> In which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO6:3,6,2PE2:4&version=47">[574]</a></sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2CO5:10,ECC12:14,ROM2:16,14:10,12,MAT12:36-37&version=47">[575]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c33p2" title="c33p2"></a>2: The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of His mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of His justice, in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT25:31-46,ROM2:5-6,ROM9:22-23,MAT5:21,ACT3:19,2TH1:7-10&version=47">[576]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c33p3" title="c33p3"></a>3: As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2PE3:11,14,2CO5:10-11,2TH1:5-7,LUK21:7,28,ROM8:23-25&version=47">[577]</a></sup> so will He have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT24:36,42-44,MAR13:35-37,LUK12:35-36,REV22:20&version=47">[578]</a></sup></p>
