<p align="center"><a name="c18" title="c18"></a>Chapter 18: Of Assurance of Grace and Salvation</p><p><a name="c18p3" title="c18p3"></a>3: This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties, before he be partaker of it:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1JO5:13,ISA1:10,MAR9:24&version=47">[357]</a></sup> yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO2:12,1JO4:13,HEB6:11-12,EPH3:17-19&version=47">[358]</a></sup> And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2PE1:10&version=47">[359]</a></sup> that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM5:1-2,5,14:17,15:13,EPH1:3-4,PSA4:6-7,119:32&version=47">[360]</a></sup>the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to looseness.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1JO2:1-2,ROM6:1-2,TIT2:11-12,14,2CO7:1,ROM8:1,12,1JO3:2-3,PSA130:4,1JO1:6-7&version=47">[361]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c18p4" title="c18p4"></a>4: True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin which wounds the conscience and grieves the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of His countenance, and suffering even such as fear Him to walk in darkness and to have no light:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=SON5:2-3,6,PSA51:8,12,14,EPH4:30-31,PSA77:1-10,MAT26:69-72,PSA31:22,88,ISA50:10&version=47">[362]</a></sup> yet are they never so utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart, and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may, in due time, be revived;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1JO3:9,LUK22:32,JOB13:15,PSA73:15,PSA51:8,12,ISA50:10&version=47">[363]</a></sup> and by the which, in the mean time, they are supported from utter despair.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MIC7:7-9,JER32:40,ISA54:7-10,PSA22:1,88&version=47">[364]</a></sup></p>
