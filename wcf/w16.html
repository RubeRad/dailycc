<p align="center"><a name="c9" title="c9"></a>Chapter 9: Of Free Will</p><p><a name="c9p1" title="c9p1"></a>1: God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that is neither forced, nor, by any absolute necessity of nature, determined good, or evil.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT17:12,JAM1:14,DEU30:19&version=47">[204]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c9p2" title="c9p2"></a>2: Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power to will and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ECC7:29,GEN1:26&version=47">[205]</a></sup> but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from it.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN2:16-17,3:6&version=47">[206]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c9p3" title="c9p3"></a>3: Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM5:6,8:7,JOH15:5&version=47">[207]</a></sup> so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM3:10,12&version=47">[208]</a></sup> and dead in sin,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPH2:1,5,COL2:13&version=47">[209]</a></sup> is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH6:44,65,EPH2:2-5,1CO2:14,TIT3:3-5&version=47">[210]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c9p4" title="c9p4"></a>4: When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COL1:13,JOH8:34,36&version=47">[211]</a></sup> and, by His grace alone, enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHI2:13,ROM6:18,22&version=47">[212]</a></sup> yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption, he does not perfectly, or only, will that which is good, but does also will that which is evil.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GAL5:17,ROM7:15,18-19,21,23&version=47">[213]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c9p5" title="c9p5"></a>5: The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to do good alone in the state of glory only.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPH4:13,HEB12:23,1JO3:2,24&version=47">[214]</a></sup></p>
