<p align="center"><a name="c19" title="c19"></a>Chapter 19: Of the Law of God</p><p><a name="c19p3" title="c19p3"></a>3: Besides this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to the people of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws, containing several typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, His graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB10:1,GAL4:1-3,COL2:17&version=47">[368]</a></sup> and partly, holding forth divers instructions of moral duties.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO5:7,2CO6:17,23&version=47">[369]</a></sup> All which ceremonial laws are now abrogated, under the New Testament.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COL2:14,16-17,DAN9:27,EPH2:15-16&version=47">[370]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c19p4" title="c19p4"></a>4: To them also, as a body politic, He gave sundry judicial laws, which expired together with the State of that people; not obliging under any now, further than the general equity thereof may require.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN49:10,1PE2:13-14,MAT5:17,38-39,1CO9:8-10&version=47">[371]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c19p5" title="c19p5"></a>5: The moral law does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM13:8-10,EPH6:2,1JO2:3-4,7-8&version=47">[372]</a></sup> and that, not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAM2:10-11&version=47">[373]</a></sup> Neither does Christ, in the Gospel, any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT5:17-19,JAM2:8,ROM3:31&version=47">[374]</a></sup></p>
