<p align="center"><a name="c11" title="c11"></a>Chapter 11: Of Justification</p><p><a name="c11p1" title="c11p1"></a>1: Those whom God effectually calls, He also freely justifies;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM8:30,ROM3:24&version=47">[234]</a></sup> not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM4:5-8,2CO5:19,21,ROM3:22,24-25,27-28,TIT3:5,7,EPH1:7,JER23:6,1CO1:30-31,ROM5:17-19&version=47">[235]</a></sup> they receiving and resting on Him and His righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT10:44,GAL2:16,PHI3:9,ACT13:38-39,EPH2:7-8&version=47">[236]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c11p2" title="c11p2"></a>2: Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH1:12,ROM3:28,ROM5:1&version=47">[237]</a></sup> yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAM2:17,22,26,GAL5:6&version=47">[238]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c11p3" title="c11p3"></a>3: Christ, by His obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real and full satisfaction to His Father's justice in their behalf.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM5:8-10,19,1TI2:5-6,HEB10:10,14,DAN9:24,26,ISA53:4-6,10-12&version=47">[239]</a></sup> Yet, in as much as He was given by the Father for them;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM8:32&version=47">[240]</a></sup> and His obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2CO5:21,MAT3:17,EPH5:2&version=47">[241]</a></sup> and both, freely, not for any thing in them; their justification is only of free grace;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM3:24,EPH1:7&version=47">[242]</a></sup> that both the exact justice, and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of sinners.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM3:26,EPH2:7&version=47">[243]</a></sup></p>
