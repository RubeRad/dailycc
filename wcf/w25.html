<p align="center"><a name="c16" title="c16"></a>Chapter 16: Of Good Works</p><p><a name="c16p1" title="c16p1"></a>1: Good works are only such as God has commanded in His holy Word,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MIC6:8,ROM12:2,HEB13:21&version=47">[305]</a></sup> and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intention.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT15:9,ISA29:13,1PE1:18,ROM10:2,JOH16:2,1SA15:21-23&version=47">[306]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c16p2" title="c16p2"></a>2: These good works, done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAM2:18,22&version=47">[307]</a></sup> and by them believers manifest their thankfulness,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSA116:12-13,1PE2:9&version=47">[308]</a></sup> strengthen their assurance,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1JO2:3,5,2PE1:5-10&version=47">[309]</a></sup> edify their brethren,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2CO9:2,MAT5:16&version=47">[310]</a></sup> adorn the profession of the Gospel,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TIT2:5,9-12,1TI6:1&version=47">[311]</a></sup> stop the mouths of the adversaries,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1PE2:15&version=47">[312]</a></sup> and glorify God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1PE2:12,PHI1:11,JOH15:8&version=47">[313]</a></sup>whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPH2:10&version=47">[314]</a></sup>that, having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM6:22&version=47">[315]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c16p3" title="c16p3"></a>3: Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH15:4-6,EZE36:26-27&version=47">[316]</a></sup> And that they may be enabled thereunto, beside the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them to will, and to do, of His good pleasure:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHI2:13,4:13,2CO3:5&version=47">[317]</a></sup> yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHI2:12,HEB6:11-12,2PE1:3,5,10-11,ISA64:7,2TI1:6,ACT26:6-7,20-21&version=47">[318]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c16p4" title="c16p4"></a>4: They who, in their obedience, attain to the greatest height which is possibly in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUK17:10,NEH13:22,JOB9:2-3,GAL5:17&version=47">[319]</a></sup></p>
