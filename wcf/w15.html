<p><a name="c8p7" title="c8p7"></a>7: Christ, in the work of mediation, acts according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB9:14,1PE3:18&version=47">[197]</a></sup> yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACT20:28,JOH3:13,1JO3:16&version=47">[198]</a></sup></p>
