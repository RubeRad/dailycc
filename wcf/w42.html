<p align="center"><a name="c25" title="c25"></a>Chapter 25: Of the Church</p><p><a name="c25p4" title="c25p4"></a>4: This catholic Church has been sometimes more, sometimes less visible.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM11:3-4,REV12:6,14&version=47">[496]</a></sup> And particular Churches, which are members thereof, are more or less pure, according as the doctrine of the Gospel is taught and embraced, ordinances administered, and public worship performed more or less purely in them.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO5:6-7&version=47">[497]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c25p5" title="c25p5"></a>5: The purest Churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO13:12,47&version=47">[498]</a></sup> and some have so degenerated, as to become no Churches of Christ, but synagogues of Satan.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=REV18:2,ROM11:18-22&version=47">[499]</a></sup> Nevertheless, there shall be always a Church on earth to worship God according to His will.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT16:18,PSA72:17,102:28,MAT28:19-20&version=47">[500]</a></sup></p>
