<p align="center"><a name="c24" title="c24"></a>Chapter 24: Of Marriage and Divorce</p><p><a name="c24p1" title="c24p1"></a>1: Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN2:24,MAT19:5-6,PRO2:17&version=47">[474]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c24p2" title="c24p2"></a>2: Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN2:18&version=47">[475]</a></sup> for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with an holy seed;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAL2:15&version=47">[476]</a></sup> and for preventing of uncleanness.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO7:2,9&version=47">[477]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c24p3" title="c24p3"></a>3: It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB13:4,1TI4:3,1CO7:36-38,GEN24:57&version=47">[478]</a></sup> Yet it is the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO7:39&version=47">[479]</a></sup> And therefore such as profess the true reformed religion should not marry with infidels, papists, or other idolaters: neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresies.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN34:14,EXO34:16,DEU7:3-4,1KI11:4,NEH13:25-27,MAL2:11-12,2CO6:14&version=47">[480]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c24p4" title="c24p4"></a>4: Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity forbidden by the Word.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO5:1,AMO2:7&version=47">[481]</a></sup> Nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful by any law of man or consent of parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAR6:18,LEV18:24-28&version=47">[482]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c24p5" title="c24p5"></a>5: Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected before marriage, gives just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT1:18-20&version=47">[484]</a></sup> In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce and, after the divorce,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT5:31-32&version=47">[485]</a></sup> to marry another, as if the offending party were dead.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT19:9,ROM7:2-3&version=47">[486]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="c24p6" title="c24p6"></a>6: Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study arguments unduly to put asunder those whom God has joined together in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied by the Church, or civil magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of marriage:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT19:8-9,1CO7:15,MAT19:6&version=47">[487]</a></sup> wherein, a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be observed; and the persons concerned in it not left to their own wills, and discretion, in their own case.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=DEU24:1-4&version=47">[488]</a></sup></p>
