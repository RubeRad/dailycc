A. The sabbath is to be sanctified by a holy resting all that day, even from such worldly employments and recreations as are lawful on other days;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:10,Nehemiah13:15-22,Isaiah58:13-14&version=47">[145]</a></sup> and spending the whole time in the public and private exercises of God's worship,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:8,Leviticus23:3,Luke4:16,Acts20:7&version=47">[146]</a></sup> except so much as is to be taken up in the works of necessity and mercy.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew12:1-13&version=47">[147]</a></sup></p>
