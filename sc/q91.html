A. The sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him that doth administer them; but only by the blessing of Christ, and the working of his Spirit in them that by faith receive them.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians3:7,Cf1Corinthians1:12-17&version=47">[188]</a></sup></p>
