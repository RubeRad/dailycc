A. It is required of them that would worthily partake of the Lord's Supper, that they examine themselves of their knowledge to discern the Lord's body, of their faith to feed upon him, of their repentance, love, and new obedience; lest, coming unworthily, they eat and drink judgment to themselves.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians11:27-32&version=47">[199]</a></sup></p>
