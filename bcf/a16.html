<p align="center"><a name="a16" title="a16"></a>Article 16: The Doctrine of Election</p><p> We believe that-- all Adam's descendants having thus fallen into perdition and ruin by the sin of the first man-- God showed himself to be as he is: merciful and just.  He is merciful in withdrawing and saving from this perdition those whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable counsel, has elected and chosen in Jesus Christ our Lord by his pure goodness, without any consideration of their works.  He is just in leaving the others in their ruin and fall into which they plunged themselves.  </p>
