<p align="center"><a name="a30" title="a30"></a>Article 30: The Government of the Church</p><p> We believe that this true church ought to be governed according to the spiritual order that our Lord has taught us in his Word. There should be ministers or pastors to preach the Word of God and adminster the sacraments. There should also be elders and deacons, along with the pastors, to make up the council of the church.  By this means true religion is preserved; true doctrine is able to take its course; and evil men are corrected spiritually and held in check, so that also the poor and all the afflicted may be helped and comforted according to their need.  By this means everything will be done well and in good order in the church, when such persons are elected who are faithful and are chosen according to the rule that Paul gave to Timothy.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Tim3&version=47">[75]</a>  </p>
<p align="center"><a name="a31" title="a31"></a>Article 31: The Officers of the Church</p><p> We believe that ministers of the Word of God, elders, and deacons ought to be chosen to their offices by a legitimate election of the church, with prayer in the name of the Lord, and in good order, as the Word of God teaches.  So everyone must be careful not to push himself forward improperly, but he must wait for God's call, so that he may be assured of his calling and be certain that he is chosen by the Lord.  As for the ministers of the Word, they all have the same power and authority, no matter where they may be, since they are all servants of Jesus Christ, the only universal bishop, and the only head of the church.  Moreover, to keep God's holy order from being violated or despised, we say that everyone ought, as much as possible, to hold the ministers of the Word and elders of the church in special esteem, because of the work they do, and be at peace with them, without grumbling, quarreling, or fighting.  </p>
<p align="center"><a name="a32" title="a32"></a>Article 32: The Order and Discipline of the Church</p><p> We also believe that although it is useful and good for those who govern the churches to establish and set up a certain order among themselves for maintaining the body of the church, they ought always to guard against deviating from what Christ, our only Master, has ordained for us.  Therefore we reject all human innovations and all laws imposed on us, in our worship of God, which bind and force our consciences in any way.  So we accept only what is proper to maintain harmony and unity and to keep all in obedience to God.  To that end excommunication, with all it involves, according to the Word of God, is required.  </p>
