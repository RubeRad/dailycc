<p align="center"><a name="a12" title="a12"></a>Article 12: The Creation of All Things</p><p> We believe that the Father created heaven and earth and all other creatures from nothing, when it seemed good to him, by his Word-- that is to say, by his Son.  He has given all creatures their being, form, and appearance, and their various functions for serving their Creator.  Even now he also sustains and governs them all, according to his eternal providence, and by his infinite power, that they may serve man, in order that man may serve God.  He has also created the angels good, that they might be his messengers and serve his elect.  Some of them have fallen from the excellence in which God created them into eternal perdition; and the others have persisted and remained in their orginal state, by the grace of God.  The devils and evil spirits are so corrupt that they are enemies of God and of everything good. They lie in wait for the church and every member of it like thieves, with all their power, to destroy and spoil everything by their deceptions.  So then, by their own wickedness they are condemned to everlasting damnation, daily awaiting their torments.  For that reason we detest the error of the Sadducees, who deny that there are spirits and angels, and also the error of the Manicheans, who say that the devils originated by themselves, being evil by nature, without having been corrupted.  </p>
