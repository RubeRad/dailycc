<p align="center"><a name="a10" title="a10"></a>Article 10: The Deity of Christ</p><p> We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only Son of God-- eternally begotten, not made nor created, for then he would be a creature.  He is one in essence with the Father; coeternal; the exact image of the person of the Father and the "reflection of his glory,"<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col1:15;Heb1:3&version=47">[13]</a> being in all things like him.  He is the Son of God not only from the time he assumed our nature but from all eternity, as the following testimonies teach us when they are taken together.  Moses says that God "created the world";<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen1:1&version=47">[14]</a> and John says that "all things were created by the Word,"<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=John1:3&version=47">[15]</a> which he calls God. The apostle says that "God made the world by his Son."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb1:2&version=47">[16]</a> He also says that "God created all things by Jesus Christ."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col1:16&version=47">[17]</a>  And so it must follow that he who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ already existed when all things were created by him.  Therefore the prophet Micah says that his origin is "from ancient times, from eternity."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mic5:2&version=47">[18]</a> And the apostle says that he has "neither beginning of days nor end of life."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:3&version=47">[19]</a>  So then, he is the true eternal God, the Almighty, whom we invoke, worship, and serve.  </p>
<p align="center"><a name="a11" title="a11"></a>Article 11: The Deity of the Holy Spirit</p><p> We believe and confess also that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son-- neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding from the two of them. In regard to order, he is the third person of the Trinity-- of one and the same essence, and majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son.  He is true and eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us.  </p>
