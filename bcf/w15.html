<p align="center"><a name="a23" title="a23"></a>Article 23: The Justification of Sinners</p><p> We believe that our blessedness lies in the forgiveness of our sins because of Jesus Christ, and that in it our righteousness before God is contained, as David and Paul teach us when they declare that man blessed to whom God grants righteousness apart from works.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps32:1;Rom4:6&version=47">[54]</a>  And the same apostle says that we are justified "freely" or "by grace" through redemption in Jesus Christ.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom3:24&version=47">[55]</a> And therefore we cling to this foundation, which is firm forever, giving all glory to God, humbling ourselves, and recognizing ourselves as we are; not claiming a thing for ourselves or our merits and leaning and resting on the sole obedience of Christ crucified, which is ours when we believe in him.  That is enough to cover all our sins and to make us confident, freeing the conscience from the fear, dread, and terror of God's approach, without doing what our first father, Adam, did, who trembled as he tried to cover himself with fig leaves.  In fact, if we had to appear before God relying-- no matter how little-- on ourselves or some other creature, then, alas, we would be swallowed up.  Therefore everyone must say with David: "Lord, do not enter into judgment with your servants, for before you no living person shall be justified."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps143:2&version=47">[56]</a>  </p>
