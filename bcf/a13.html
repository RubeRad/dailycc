Yet God is not the author of, nor can he be charged with, the sin that occurs. For his power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible that he arranges and does his work very well and justly even when the devils and wicked men act unjustly.  We do not wish to inquire with undue curiosity into what he does that surpasses human understanding and is beyond our ability to comprehend. But in all humility and reverence we adore the just judgments of God, which are hidden from us, being content to be Christ's disciples, so as to learn only what he shows us in his Word, without going beyond those limits.  This doctrine gives us unspeakable comfort since it teaches us that nothing can happen to us by chance but only by the arrangement of our gracious heavenly Father. He watches over us with fatherly care, keeping all creatures under his control, so that not one of the hairs on our heads (for they are all numbered) nor even a little bird can fall to the ground<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt10:29-30&version=47">[20]</a> without the will of our Father.  In this thought we rest, knowing that he holds in check the devils and all our enemies, who cannot hurt us without his permission and will.  For that reason we reject the damnable error of the Epicureans, who say that God involves himself in nothing and leaves everything to chance.  </p>
