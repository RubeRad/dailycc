<p align="center"><a name="a15" title="a15"></a>Article 15: The Doctrine of Original Sin</p><p> We believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race.  It is a corruption of all nature-- an inherited depravity which even infects small infants in their mother's womb, and the root which produces in man every sort of sin. It is therefore so vile and enormous in God's sight that it is enough to condemn the human race, and it is not abolished or wholly uprooted even by baptism, seeing that sin constantly boils forth as though from a contaminated spring.  Nevertheless, it is not imputed to God's children for their condemnation but is forgiven by his grace and mercy-- not to put them to sleep but so that the awareness of this corruption might often make believers groan as they long to be set free from the "body of this death."<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:24&version=47">[30]</a>  Therefore we reject the error of the Pelagians who say that this sin is nothing else than a matter of imitation.  </p>
