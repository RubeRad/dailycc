<p align="center"><a name="a5" title="a5"></a>Article 5: The Authority of Scripture</p><p> We receive all these books and these only as holy and canonical, for the regulating, founding, and establishing of our faith.   And we believe without a doubt all things contained in them-- not so much because the church receives and approves them as such but above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God.  For even the blind themselves are able to see that the things predicted in them do happen.  </p>
