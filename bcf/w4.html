<p align="center"><a name="a8" title="a8"></a>Article 8: The Trinity</p><p> In keeping with this truth and Word of God we believe in one God, who is one single essence, in whom there are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties-- namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible.  The Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father.  The Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son.  Nevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has his own subsistence distinguished by characteristics-- yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God.  It is evident then that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father, and that likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son.  Nevertheless, these persons, thus distinct, are neither divided nor fused or mixed together.  For the Father did not take on flesh, nor did the Spirit, but only the Son.  The Father was never without his Son, nor without his Holy Spirit, since all these are equal from eternity, in one and the same essence.  There is neither a first nor a last, for all three are one in truth and power, in goodness and mercy.  </p>
