<p align="center"><a name="a3" title="a3"></a>Article 3: The Written Word of God</p><p> We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of men, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as Peter says.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Pet1:21&version=47">[1]</a>  Afterwards our God-- because of the special care he has for us and our salvation-- commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing. He himself wrote with his own finger the two tables of the law.  Therefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures. </p>
