<p align="center"><a name="a1" title="a1"></a>Article 1: The Only God</p><p> We all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being, whom we call God -- eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty; completely wise, just, and good, and the overflowing source of all good.   </p>
<p align="center"><a name="a2" title="a2"></a>Article 2: The Means by Which We Know God</p><p> We know him by two means:  First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book in which all creatures, great and small, are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God: his eternal power and his divinity, as the apostle Paul says in Romans 1:20.  All these things are enough to convict men and to leave them without excuse.  Second, he makes himself known to us more openly by his holy and divine Word, as much as we need in this life, for his glory and for the salvation of his own.  </p>
<p align="center"><a name="a3" title="a3"></a>Article 3: The Written Word of God</p><p> We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of men, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as Peter says.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Pet1:21&version=47">[1]</a>  Afterwards our God-- because of the special care he has for us and our salvation-- commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing. He himself wrote with his own finger the two tables of the law.  Therefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures. </p>
