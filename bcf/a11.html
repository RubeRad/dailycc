<p align="center"><a name="a11" title="a11"></a>Article 11: The Deity of the Holy Spirit</p><p> We believe and confess also that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son-- neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding from the two of them. In regard to order, he is the third person of the Trinity-- of one and the same essence, and majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son.  He is true and eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us.  </p>
