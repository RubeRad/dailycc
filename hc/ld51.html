A. "And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors"; that is, be pleased for the sake of Christ's blood, not to impute to us poor sinners, our transgressions, nor that depravity, which always cleaves to us; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps51:1-7,Ps143:2,1John2:1-2,Rom8:1&version=47">[a]</a> even as we feel this evidence of thy grace in us, that it is our firm resolution from the heart to forgive our neighbour. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a></p>
