A. First, by his resurrection he has overcome death, that he might make us partakers of that righteousness which he had purchased for us by his death; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor15:16,Rom4:25,1Pet1:3&version=47">[a]</a> secondly, we are also by his power raised up to a new life; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:4,Col3:1,Col3:3,Eph2:5-6&version=47">[b]</a> and lastly, the resurrection of Christ is a sure pledge of our blessed resurrection. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor15:12,1Cor15:20-21,Rom8:11&version=47">[c]</a></p>
