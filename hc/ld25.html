A. From the Holy Ghost, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph2:8-9,Eph6:23&version=47">[a]</a> who works faith in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel, and confirms it by the use of the sacraments. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet1:22-23&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q66" title="q66"></a>Q. 66. <b>What are the sacraments?</b><br />
A. The sacraments are holy visible signs and seals, appointed of God for this end, that by the use thereof, he may the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel, viz., that he grants us freely the remission of sin, and life eternal, for the sake of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen17:11,Rom4:11,Deut30:6,Lev6:25,Heb9:7-9,Heb9:24,Ezek20:12,Isa6:6-7,Isa54:9&version=47">[a]</a></p><p><a name="q67" title="q67"></a>Q. 67. <b>Are both word and sacraments, then, ordained and appointed for this end, that they may direct our faith to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, as the only ground of our salvation? <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:3,Gal3:27&version=47">[a]</a></b><br />
A. Yes, indeed: for the Holy Ghost teaches us in the gospel, and assures us by the sacraments, that the whole of our salvation depends upon that one sacrifice of Christ which he offered for us on the cross.</p><p><a name="q68" title="q68"></a>Q. 68. <b>How many sacraments has Christ instituted in the new covenant, or testament?</b><br />
