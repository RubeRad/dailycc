A. By no means; but God created man good, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen1:31&version=47">[a]</a> and after his own image, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen1:26-27&version=47">[b]</a> in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise him. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col3:9-10,Eph4:23-24,2Cor3:18&version=47">[c]</a></p><p><a name="q7" title="q7"></a>Q. 7. <b>Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?</b><br />
A. From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom5:12,Rom5:18-19&version=47">[a]</a> hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all conceived and born in sin. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps51:5,Gen5:3&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q8" title="q8"></a>Q. 8. <b>Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good, and inclined to all wickedness?</b><br />
