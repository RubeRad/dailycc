A. Because Christ, having redeemed and delivered us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit, after his own image; that so we may testify, by the whole of our conduct, our gratitude to God for his blessings, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:13,Rom12:1-2,1Pet2:5,1Pet2:9-10,1Cor6:20&version=47">[a]</a> and that he may be praised by us; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet2:12,1Pet1:6-7&version=47">[b]</a> also, that every one may be assured in himself of his faith, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Pet1:10,Gal5:6,Gal5:22-23&version=47">[c]</a> by the fruits thereof; and that, by our godly conversation others may be gained to Christ. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet3:1-2,Rom14:19&version=47">[d]</a></p><p><a name="q87" title="q87"></a>Q. 87. <b>Cannot they then be saved, who, continuing in their wicked and ungrateful lives, are not converted to God?</b><br />
A. By no means; for the holy scripture declares that no unchaste person, idolater, adulterer, thief, covetous man, drunkard, slanderer, robber, or any such like, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor6:9-10,Eph5:5-6,1John3:14&version=47">[a]</a></p>
