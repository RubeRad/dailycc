A. That Christ, in sight of his disciples, was taken up from earth into heaven; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts1:9,Mark16:19,Luke24:51&version=47">[a]</a> and that he continues there for our interest, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:25,Heb4:14,Heb9:24,Rom8:34,Eph4:10,Col3:1&version=47">[b]</a> until he comes again to judge the quick and the dead. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts1:11&version=47">[c]</a></p><p><a name="q47" title="q47"></a>Q. 47. <b>Is not Christ then with us even to the end of the world, as he has promised? </b><br />
A. Christ is very man and very God; with respect to his human nature, he is no more on earth;  but with respect to his Godhead, majesty, grace and spirit, he is at no time absent from us <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt28:20,Heb8:4,Matt26:11,John16:28,John17:11,Acts3:21,John14:17-19,John16:13,Eph4:8,Eph4:12&version=47">[a]</a>.</p><p><a name="q48" title="q48"></a>Q. 48. <b>But if his human nature is not present, wherever his Godhead is, are not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?</b><br />
A. Not as all, for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts7:49,Jer23:24&version=47">[a]</a> it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the human nature he assumed, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col2:9&version=47">[b]</a> and yet is nevertheless in this human nature, and remains personally united to it.</p><p><a name="q49" title="q49"></a>Q. 49. <b>Of what advantage to us is Christ's ascension into heaven?</b><br />
A. First, that he is our advocate in the presence of his Father in heaven; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1John2:1,Rom8:34&version=47">[a]</a> secondly, that we have our flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that he, as the head, will also take up to himself, us, his members; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph2:6&version=47">[b]</a> thirdly, that he sends us his Spirit as an earnest, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts2:1-4,Acts2:33,2Cor1:22,2Cor5:5&version=47">[c]</a> by whose power we "seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God, and not things on earth." <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col3:1&version=47">[d]</a></p>
