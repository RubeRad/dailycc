A. Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps50:14-15&version=47">[a]</a> and also, because God will give his grace and Holy Spirit to those only, who with sincere desires continually ask them of him, and are thankful for them. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke11:9-10,Luke11:13,1Thess5:17&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q117" title="q117"></a>Q. 117. <b>What are the requisites of that prayer, which is acceptable to God, and which he will hear?</b><br />
A. First, that we from the heart pray <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps145:18&version=47">[a]</a> to the one true God only, who has manifested himself in his word, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rev19:10&version=47">[b]</a> for all things, he has commanded us to ask of him; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:26,1John5:14,James1:5&version=47">[c]</a> secondly, that we rightly and thoroughly know our need and misery, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Chron20:12&version=47">[d]</a> that so we may deeply humble ourselves in the presence of his divine majesty; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps2:11,Ps34:19,Isa66:2&version=47">[e]</a> thirdly, that we be fully persuaded that he, notwithstanding that we are unworthy of it, will, for the sake of Christ our Lord, certainly hear our prayer, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:14,James1:6&version=47">[f]</a> as he has promised us in his word. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Dan9:17-18&version=47">[g]</a></p><p><a name="q118" title="q118"></a>Q. 118. <b>What has God commanded us to ask of him?</b><br />
A. All things necessary for soul and body;  which Christ our Lord has comprised in that prayer he himself has taught us.  James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Matt.6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p><p><a name="q119" title="q119"></a>Q. 119. <b>What are the words of that prayer? <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke11:2-4&version=47">[a]</a></b><br />
A. Our Father which art in heaven, 1 Hallowed be thy name. 2 Thy kingdom come. 3 Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. 4 Give us this day our daily bread. 5 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 6 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
