A. That we in no wise represent God by images, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut4:15-19,Isa40:18-25,Rom1:23-24,Acts17:29&version=47">[a]</a> nor worship him in any other way than he has commanded in his word. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Sam15:23,Deut12:30-32&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q97" title="q97"></a>Q. 97. <b>Are images then not at all to be made?</b><br />
A. God neither can, nor may be represented by any means: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa40:25&version=47">[a]</a> but as to creatures; though they may be represented, yet God forbids to make, or have any resemblance of them, either in order to worship them or to serve God by them. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Exod23:24-25,Exod34:13-14,Exod34:17,Num33:52,Deut7:5,Deut12:3,Deut16:21,2Kin18:3-4&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q98" title="q98"></a>Q. 98. <b>But may not images be tolerated in the churches, as books to the laity?</b><br />
A. No: for we must not pretend to be wiser than God, who will have his people taught, not by dumb images, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer10:8,Hab2:18-19&version=47">[a]</a> but by the lively preaching of his word. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:14-15,Rom10:17,2Pet1:19,2Tim3:16-17&version=47">[b]</a></p>
