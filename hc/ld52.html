A. "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; that is, since we are so weak in ourselves, that we cannot stand a moment; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps103:14&version=47">[a]</a> and besides this, since our mortal enemies, the devil, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet5:8,Eph6:12&version=47">[b]</a> the world, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[c]</a> and our own flesh, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:23,Gal5:17&version=47">[d]</a> cease not to assault us, do thou therefore preserve and strengthen us by the power of thy Holy Spirit, that we may not be overcome in this spiritual warfare, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark13:33&version=47">[e]</a> but constantly and strenuously may resist our foes, till at last we obtain a complete victory. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Thess3:13,1Thess5:23&version=47">[f]</a></p><p><a name="q128" title="q128"></a>Q. 128. <b>How dost thou conclude thy prayer?</b><br />
A. "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever"; that is, all these we ask of thee, because thou, being our King and almighty, art willing and able to give us all good; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:11-12,2Pet2:9&version=47">[a]</a> and all this we pray for, that thereby not we, but thy holy name, may be glorified for ever. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer33:8-9,Ps115:1&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q129" title="q129"></a>Q. 129. <b>What does the word "Amen" signify?</b><br />
A. "Amen" signifies, it shall truly and certainly be: for my prayer is more assuredly heard of God, than I feel in my heart that I desire these things of him. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor1:20,2Tim2:13&version=47">[a]</a></p>
