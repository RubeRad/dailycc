A. "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"; that is, grant that we and all men may renounce our own will, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Tit2:11-12&version=47">[a]</a> and without murmuring obey thy will, which is only good; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke22:42,Eph5:10,Rom12:2&version=47">[b]</a> that every one may attend to, and perform the duties of his station and calling, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor7:24&version=47">[c]</a> as willingly and faithfully as the angels do in heaven. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps103:20-21&version=47">[d]</a></p>
