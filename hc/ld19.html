A. Because Christ is ascended into heaven for this end, that he might appear as head of his church, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph1:20-21,Eph1:23,Col1:18&version=47">[a]</a> by whom the Father governs all things. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q51" title="q51"></a>Q. 51. <b>What profit is this glory of Christ, our head, unto us?</b><br />
A. First, that by his Holy Spirit he pours out heavenly graces upon us his members; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts2:33,Eph4:8&version=47">[a]</a> and then that by his power he defends and preserves us against all enemies. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps2:9,Ps110:1-2,Eph4:8&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q52" title="q52"></a>Q. 52. <b>What comfort is it to thee that "Christ shall come again to judge the quick and the dead"?</b><br />
A. That in all my sorrows and persecutions, with uplifted head I look for the very same person, who before offered himself for my sake, to the tribunal of God, and has removed all curse from me, to come as judge from heaven: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke21:28,Rom8:23,Tit2:13,1Thess4:16&version=47">[a]</a> who shall cast all his and my enemies into everlasting condemnation, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Thess1:6,2Thess1:8-10&version=47">[b]</a> but shall translate me with all his chosen ones to himself, into heavenly joys and glory. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Thess1:7&version=47">[c]</a></p>
