A. Because, that the righteousness, which can be approved of before the tribunal of God, must be absolutely perfect, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gal3:10,Deut27:26&version=47">[a]</a> and in all respects conformable to the divine law; and also, that our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa64:6&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q63" title="q63"></a>Q. 63. <b>What! do not our good works merit, which yet God will reward in this and in a future life?</b><br />
A. This reward is not of merit, but of grace. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke17:10&version=47">[a]</a></p><p><a name="q64" title="q64"></a>Q. 64. <b>But does not this doctrine make men careless and profane?</b><br />
A. By no means: for it is impossible that those, who are implanted into Christ by a true faith, should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a></p>
