<p><a name="q1" title="q1"></a>Q. 1. <b>What is thy only comfort in life and death?</b><br />
A. That I with body and soul, both in life and death, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom14:7-8&version=47">[a]</a> am not my own, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor6:19&version=47">[b]</a> but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor3:23,Tit2:14&version=47">[c]</a> who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet1:18-19,1John1:7,1John2:2,1John2:12&version=47">[d]</a> and delivered me from all the power of the devil; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb2:14,1John3:8&version=47">[e]</a> and so preserves me <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Thess3:3,1Pet1:5&version=47">[f]</a> that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke21:18&version=47">[g]</a> yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:28&version=47">[h]</a> and therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also assures me of eternal life, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor1:20-22,2Cor5:5,Eph1:13-14,Rom8:16&version=47">[i]</a> and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:14,1John3:3&version=47">[j]</a></p>
<p><a name="q2" title="q2"></a>Q. 2. <b>How many things are necessary for thee to know, that thou, enjoying this comfort, mayest live and die happily?</b><br />
A. Three; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke24:46-48,1Cor6:11,Tit3:3-7&version=47">[a]</a> the first, how great my sins and miseries are; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a> the second, how I may be delivered from all my sins and miseries; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts4:12,Acts10:43&version=47">[c]</a> the third, how I shall express my gratitude to God for such deliverance. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph5:8-11,1Pet2:9-10,Rom6:1-2,Rom6:12-13&version=47">[d]</a></p>

<p><a name="q3" title="q3"></a>Q. 3. <b>Whence knowest thou thy misery?</b><br />
A. Out of the law of God. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom3:20&version=47">[a]</a></p>
<p><a name="q4" title="q4"></a>Q. 4. <b>What does the law of God require of us?</b><br />
A. Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and the great commandment; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut6:5,Lev19:18,Mark12:30,Luke10:27&version=47">[a]</a></p>
<p><a name="q5" title="q5"></a>Q. 5. <b>Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?</b><br />
A. In no wise; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom3:10,Rom3:20,Rom3:23,1John1:8,1John1:10&version=47">[a]</a> for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour.<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:7,Eph2:3,Tit3:3,Gen6:5,Gen8:21,Jer17:9,Rom7:23&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p align="center"><a name="ld3" title="ld3"></a><b>3. Lord's Day</b></p>
<p><a name="q6" title="q6"></a>Q. 6. <b>Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?</b><br />
A. By no means; but God created man good, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen1:31&version=47">[a]</a> and after his own image, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen1:26-27&version=47">[b]</a> in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise him. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col3:9-10,Eph4:23-24,2Cor3:18&version=47">[c]</a></p>
<p><a name="q7" title="q7"></a>Q. 7. <b>Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?</b><br />
A. From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom5:12,Rom5:18-19&version=47">[a]</a> hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all conceived and born in sin. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps51:5,Gen5:3&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q8" title="q8"></a>Q. 8. <b>Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good, and inclined to all wickedness?</b><br />
A. Indeed we are; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen8:21,Gen6:5,Job14:4,Job15:14,Job15:16,Job15:35,Isa53:6&version=47">[a]</a> except we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor12:3,2Cor3:5&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p align="center"><a name="ld4" title="ld4"></a><b>4. Lord's Day</b></p>
<p><a name="q9" title="q9"></a>Q. 9. <b>Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his law, that which he cannot perform?</b><br />
A. Not at all; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph4:24,Eccl7:29&version=47">[a]</a> for God made man capable of performing it; but man, by the instigation of the devil, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor11:3,Gen3:4&version=47">[b]</a> and his own wilful disobedience, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen3:6,Rom5:12,Gen3:13,1Tim2:13-14&version=47">[c]</a> deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.</p>
<p><a name="q10" title="q10"></a>Q. 10. <b>Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?</b><br />
A. By no means; but is terribly displeased <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen2:17,Rom5:12&version=47">[a]</a> with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally and eternally, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps5:5,Ps50:21,Nah1:2,Exod20:5,Exod34:7,Rom1:18,Eph5:6,Heb9:27&version=47">[b]</a> as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law, to do them." <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut27:26,Gal3:10&version=47">[c]</a></p>
<p><a name="q11" title="q11"></a>Q. 11. <b>Is not God then also merciful?</b><br />
A. God is indeed merciful, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Exod34:6-7,Exod20:6&version=47">[a]</a> but also just; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps7:9,Exod20:5,Exod23:7,Exod34:7,Ps5:5-6,Nah1:2-3&version=47">[b]</a> therefore his justice requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting punishment of body and soul.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ld5" title="ld5"></a><b>5. Lord's Day</b></p>
<p><a name="q12" title="q12"></a>Q. 12. <b>Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that punishment, and be again received into favour?</b><br />
A. God will have his justice satisfied: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen2:17,Exod20:5,Exod23:7,Ezek18:4,2Thess1:6,Luke16:2&version=47">[a]</a> and therefore we must make this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:3-4&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q13" title="q13"></a>Q. 13. <b>Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?</b><br />
A. By no means; but on the contrary we daily increase our debt. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Job9:2-3,Job15:15-16,Job4:18-19,Ps130:3&version=47">[a]</a></p>
<p><a name="q14" title="q14"></a>Q. 14. <b>Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to satisfy for us?</b><br />
A. None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin which man has committed; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ezek18:4,Gen3:17,Heb2:14-17&version=47">[a]</a> and further, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others from it. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Nah1:6,Ps130:3&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q15" title="q15"></a>Q. 15. <b>What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?</b><br />
A. For one who is very man, and perfectly <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor15:21,Jer33:16,Isa53:9,2Cor5:21&version=47">[a]</a> righteous; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:26,Heb7:16&version=47">[b]</a> and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa7:14,Isa9:6,Rom9:5,Jer23:5-6,Luke11:22&version=47">[c]</a></p>
<p align="center"><a name="ld6" title="ld6"></a><b>6. Lord's Day</b></p>
<p><a name="q16" title="q16"></a>Q. 16. <b>Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?</b><br />
A. Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ezek18:4,Ezek18:20,Rom5:12,Rom5:15,Rom5:18,1Cor15:21,Heb2:14-16,1Pet3:18,Isa53:3-5,Isa53:10-11&version=47">[a]</a> and one, who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:26-27,Ps49:7-8,1Pet3:18&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q17" title="q17"></a>Q. 17. <b>Why must he in one person be also very God?</b><br />
A. That he might, by the power of his Godhead <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa9:6,Isa63:3&version=47">[a]</a> sustain in his human nature, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa53:4,Isa53:11&version=47">[b]</a> the burden of God's wrath; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut4:24,Nah1:6,Ps130:3&version=47">[c]</a> and might obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa53:5,Isa53:11,Acts2:24,1Pet3:18,Acts20:28&version=47">[d]</a></p>

<p><a name="q19" title="q19"></a>Q. 19. <b>Whence knowest thou this?</b><br />
A. From the holy gospel, which God himself first revealed in Paradise; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen3:15&version=47">[a]</a> and afterwards published by the patriarchs <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen22:18,Gen12:3,Gen49:10-11&version=47">[b]</a> and prophets, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa42:1-4,Isa43:25,Isa49:5-6,Isa49:22-23,Jer23:5-6,Jer31:32-33,Jer32:39-41,Mic7:18-20,Acts10:43,Rom1:2,Heb1:1,Acts3:22-24,Acts10:43&version=47">[c]</a> and represented by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb10:1,Heb10:7,Col2:7&version=47">[d]</a> and lastly, has fulfilled it by his only begotten Son. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:4,Gal4:4-5,Gal3:24,Col2:17&version=47">[e]</a></p>

A. True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in his word, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=James2:19&version=47">[a]</a> but also an assured confidence, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor4:13,Eph2:7-9,Eph3:12,Gal2:16,Heb11:1,Heb11:7-10,Heb4:16,James1:6,Rom4:17,Rom4:21,Rom5:1,Rom1:16,Rom10:10,Rom10:17,Rom4:16,Rom4:18-20,Rom3:24-25&version=47">[b]</a> which the Holy Ghost <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gal5:22,2Cor4:13,Eph2:8,Acts16:14&version=47">[c]</a> works by the gospel in my heart; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom1:16,Rom10:17,1Cor1:21,Acts10:44,Acts16:14&version=47">[d]</a> that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting righteousness and salvation, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom1:17,Gal3:11,Heb10:10,Heb10:38,Gal2:16&version=47">[e]</a> are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph2:8,Rom3:24,Rom5:19,Luke1:77-78&version=47">[f]</a></p>

<p><a name="q23" title="q23"></a>Q. 23. <b>What are these articles?</b><br />
A. 1. I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: 2. And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord: 3. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary: 4. Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell: 5. The third day he rose again from the dead: 6.

<p><a name="q29" title="q29"></a>Q. 29. <b>Why is the Son of God called "Jesus", that is a Saviour?</b><br />
A. Because he saveth us, and delivereth us from our sins; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:24-25&version=47">[a]</a> and likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in any other. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts4:12,1Tim2:5,Isa43:11,1John5:11&version=47">[b]</a></p>

<p><a name="q38" title="q38"></a>Q. 38. <b>Why did he suffer "under Pontius Pilate, as judge"?</b><br />
A.

<p><a name="q40" title="q40"></a>Q. 40. <b>Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even "unto death"?</b><br />
A.

<p><a name="q42" title="q42"></a>Q. 42. <b>Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?</b><br />
A. Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark8:37,Ps49:7&version=47">[a]</a> but only an abolishing of sin, and a passage into eternal life. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:24&version=47">[b]</a></p>

A.

<p><a name="q47" title="q47"></a>Q. 47. <b>Is not Christ then with us even to the end of the world, as he has promised? </b><br />
A.

<p><a name="q48" title="q48"></a>Q. 48. <b>But if his human nature is not present, wherever his Godhead is, are not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?</b><br />
A. Not as all, for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts7:49,Jer23:24&version=47">[a]</a> it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the human nature he assumed, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col2:9&version=47">[b]</a> and yet is nevertheless in this human nature, and remains personally united to it.</p>

<p><a name="q63" title="q63"></a>Q. 63. <b>What! do not our good works merit, which yet God will reward in this and in a future life?</b><br />
A. This reward is not of merit, but of grace. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke17:10&version=47">[a]</a></p>
<p><a name="q64" title="q64"></a>Q. 64. <b>But does not this doctrine make men careless and profane?</b><br />
A. By no means: for it is impossible that those, who are implanted into Christ by a true faith, should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a></p>

<p><a name="q65" title="q65"></a>Q. 65. <b>Since then we are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by faith only, whence does this faith proceed?</b><br />
A. From the Holy Ghost, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph2:8-9,Eph6:23&version=47">[a]</a> who works faith in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel, and confirms it by the use of the sacraments. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet1:22-23&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q66" title="q66"></a>Q. 66. <b>What are the sacraments?</b><br />
A. The sacraments are holy visible signs and seals, appointed of God for this end, that by the use thereof, he may the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel, viz., that he grants us freely the remission of sin, and life eternal, for the sake of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen17:11,Rom4:11,Deut30:6,Lev6:25,Heb9:7-9,Heb9:24,Ezek20:12,Isa6:6-7,Isa54:9&version=47">[a]</a></p>

A. Yes, indeed: for the Holy Ghost teaches us in the gospel, and assures us by the sacraments, that the whole of our salvation depends upon that one sacrifice of Christ which he offered for us on the cross.</p>
<p><a name="q68" title="q68"></a>Q. 68. <b>How many sacraments has Christ instituted in the new covenant, or testament?</b><br />
A. Two: namely, holy baptism, and the holy supper.</p>

<p><a name="q69" title="q69"></a>Q. 69. <b>How art thou admonished and assured by holy baptism, that the one sacrifice of Christ upon the cross is of real advantage to thee?</b><br />
A. Thus: That Christ appointed this external washing with water, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt28:19&version=47">[a]</a> adding thereto this promise, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt28:19,Acts2:38,Mark16:16,Rom6:3-4&version=47">[b]</a> that I am as certainly washed by his blood and Spirit from all the pollution of my soul, that is, from all my sins, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet3:21,Mark1:4,Luke3:3&version=47">[c]</a> as I am washed externally with water, by which the filthiness of the body is commonly washed away.</p>
<p><a name="q70" title="q70"></a>Q. 70. <b>What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?</b><br />
A. It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely, for the sake of Christ's blood, which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb12:24,1Pet1:2,Rev1:5,Rev7:14,Zech13:1,Ezek36:25&version=47">[a]</a> and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be members of Christ, that so we may more and more die unto sin, and lead holy and unblamable lives. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor6:11,1Cor12:13,Rom6:4,Col2:12&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q71" title="q71"></a>Q. 71. <b>Where has Christ promised us, that he will as certainly wash us by his blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?</b><br />
A. In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed: "Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost", Matt.28:19. And "he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16. This promise is also repeated, where the scripture calls baptism "the washing of regenerations" and the washing away of sins. Tit.3:5, Acts 22:16. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Tit3:5,Acts22:16&version=47">[a]</a></p>

<p><a name="q72" title="q72"></a>Q. 72. <b>Is then the external baptism with water the washing away of sin itself?</b><br />
A. Not at all: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet3:21,Eph5:26-27&version=47">[a]</a> for the blood of Jesus Christ only, and the Holy Ghost cleanse us from all sin. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1John1:7,1Cor6:11&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q73" title="q73"></a>Q. 73. <b>Why then does the Holy Ghost call baptism "the washing of regeneration," and "the washing away of sins"?</b><br />
A. God speaks thus not without great cause, to-wit, not only thereby to teach us, that as the filth of the body is purged away by water, so our sins are removed by the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rev1:5,Rev7:14,1Cor6:11&version=47">[a]</a> but especially that by this divine pledge and sign he may assure us, that we are spiritually cleansed from our sins as really, as we are externally washed with water. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark16:16,Gal3:27&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q74" title="q74"></a>Q. 74. <b>Are infants also to be baptized?</b><br />
A. Yes: for since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant and church of God; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen17:7&version=47">[a]</a> and since redemption from sin <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a> by the blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the author of faith, is promised to them no less than to the adult; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke1:15,Ps22:10,Isa44:1-3,Acts2:39&version=47">[c]</a> they must therefore by baptism, as a sign of the covenant, be also admitted into the christian church; and be distinguished from the children of unbelievers <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts10:47&version=47">[d]</a> as was done in the old covenant or testament by circumcision, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen17:14&version=47">[e]</a> instead of which baptism is instituted <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col2:11-13&version=47">[f]</a> in the new covenant.</p>

<p><a name="q75" title="q75"></a>Q. 75. <b>How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper, that thou art a partaker of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross, and of all his benefits?</b><br />
A. Thus: That Christ has commanded me and all believers, to eat of this broken bread, and to drink of this cup, in remembrance of him, adding these promises: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark14:22-24,Luke22:19-20,1Cor10:16-17,1Cor11:23-25,1Cor12:13&version=47">[a]</a> first, that his body was offered and broken on the cross for me, and his blood shed for me, as certainly as I see with my eyes, the bread of the Lord broken for me, and the cup communicated to me; and further, that he feeds and nourishes my soul to everlasting life, with his crucified body and shed blood, as assuredly as I receive from the hands of the minister, and taste with my mouth the bread and cup of the Lord, as certain signs of the body and blood of Christ.</p>
<p><a name="q76" title="q76"></a>Q. 76. <b>What is it then to eat the crucified body, and drink the shed blood of Christ?</b><br />
A. It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and death of Christ and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin, and life eternal; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a> but also, besides that, to become more and more united to his sacred body, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a> by the Holy Ghost, who dwells both in Christ and in us; so that we, though Christ is in heaven <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Col3:1,Acts3:21,1Cor11:26&version=47">[c]</a> and we on earth, are notwithstanding "flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone" <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph3:16,Eph5:29-30,Eph5:32,1Cor6:15,1Cor6:17,1Cor6:19,1John3:24,1John4:13&version=47">[d]</a> and that we live, and are governed forever by one spirit, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph4:15-16&version=47">[e]</a> as members of the same body are by one soul.</p>
<p><a name="q77" title="q77"></a>Q. 77. <b>Where has Christ promised that he will as certainly feed and nourish believers with his body and bleed, as they eat of this broken bread, and drink of this cup?</b><br />
A. In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor11:23-25,Mark14:22-24,Luke22:19-20,1Cor10:16-17&version=47">[a]</a> "The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said: eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying: this cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come." 1 Cor.11:23-26. This promise is repeated by the holy apostle Paul, where he says "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread." 1 Cor.10:16,17.</p>

<p><a name="q78" title="q78"></a>Q. 78. <b>Do then the bread and wine become the very body and blood of Christ?</b><br />
A. Not at all: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a> but as the water in baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ, neither is the washing away of sin itself, being only the sign and confirmation thereof appointed of God; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph5:26,Tit3:5&version=47">[b]</a> so the bread in the Lord's supper is not changed into the very body of Christ; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark14:24,1Cor10:16-17,1Cor11:26-28&version=47">[c]</a> though agreeably to the nature and properties of sacraments, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen17:10-11,Gen17:14,Gen17:19,Exod12:11,Exod12:13,Exod12:27,Exod12:43,Exod12:48,Exod13:9,1Pet3:21,1Cor10:1-4&version=47">[d]</a> it is called the body of Christ Jesus.</p>

A. Christ speaks thus, not without great reason, namely, not only thereby to teach us, that as bread and wine support this temporal life, so his crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and drink, whereby our souls are fed to eternal life; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a> but more especially by these visible signs and pledges to assure us, that we are as really partakers of his true body and blood by the operation of the Holy Ghost as we receive by the mouths of our bodies these holy signs in remembrance of him; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor10:16-17&version=47">[b]</a> and that all his sufferings and obedience are as certainly ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction for our sins to God.</p>

<p><a name="q80" title="q80"></a>Q. 80. <b>What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the popish mass?</b><br />
A. The Lord's supper testifies to us, that we have a full pardon of all sin by the only sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which he himself has once accomplished on the cross; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:27,Heb9:12,Heb9:25-28,Heb10:10,Heb10:12-14,Luke22:19-20&version=47">[a]</a> and, that we by the Holy Ghost are ingrafted into Christ, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor6:17,1Cor10:16&version=47">[b]</a> who, according to his human nature is now not on earth, but in heaven, at the right hand of God his Father, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb1:3,Heb8:1-2&version=47">[c]</a> and will there be worshipped by us. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke24:52,Acts7:55-56,Col3:1,1Thess1:10,Heb9:6-10&version=47">[d]</a> But the mass teaches, that the living and dead have not the pardon of sins through the sufferings of Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them by the priests; and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and wine, and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at bottom, is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb9:26,Heb10:12,Heb10:14,Heb10:19-31&version=47">[e]</a></p>
<p><a name="q81" title="q81"></a>Q. 81. <b>For whom is the Lord's supper instituted?</b><br />
A. For those who are truly sorrowful for their sins, and yet trust that these are forgiven them for the sake of Christ; and that their remaining infirmities are covered by his passion and death; and who also earnestly desire to have their faith more and more strengthened, and their lives more holy; but hypocrites, and such as turn not to God with sincere hearts, eat and drink judgment to themselves. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor10:19-22,1Cor11:28-29&version=47">[a]</a></p>
<p><a name="q82" title="q82"></a>Q. 82. <b>Are they also to be admitted to this supper, who, by confession and life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly?</b><br />
A. No; for by this, the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath kindled against the whole congregation; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor11:20,1Cor11:34,Isa1:11-15,Isa66:3,Jer7:21-23,Ps50:16&version=47">[a]</a> therefore it is the duty of the christian church, according to the appointment of Christ and his apostles, to exclude such persons, by the keys of the kingdom of heaven, till they show amendment of life.</p>

<p><a name="q83" title="q83"></a>Q. 83. <b>What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?</b><br />
A. The preaching of the holy gospel, and christian discipline, or excommunication out of the christian church; by these two, the kingdom of heaven is opened to believers, and shut against unbelievers.</p>
<p><a name="q84" title="q84"></a>Q. 84. <b>How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of the holy gospel?</b><br />
A. Thus: when according to the command of Christ, it is declared and publicly testified to all and every believer, that, whenever they receive the promise of the gospel by a true faith, all their sins are really forgiven them of God, for the sake of Christ's merits; and on the contrary, when it is declared and testified to all unbelievers, and such as do not sincerely repent, that they stand exposed to the wrath of God, and eternal condemnation, so long as they are unconverted: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[a]</a> according to which testimony of the gospel, God will judge them, both in this, and in the life to come.</p>
<p><a name="q85" title="q85"></a>Q. 85. <b>How is the kingdom of heaven shut and opened by christian discipline?</b><br />
A. Thus: when according to the command of Christ, those, who under the name of christians, maintain doctrines, or practices inconsistent therewith, and will not, after having been often brotherly admonished, renounce their errors and wicked course of life, are complained of to the church, or to those, who are thereunto appointed by the church; and if they despise their admonition, are by them forbidden the use of the sacraments; whereby they are excluded from the christian church, and by God himself from the kingdom of Christ; and when they promise and show real amendment, are again received as members of Christ and his church. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor5:2-5,1Cor5:11,2Thess3:14-15,2Cor2:6-8&version=47">[a]</a></p>

A. Because Christ, having redeemed and delivered us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit, after his own image; that so we may testify, by the whole of our conduct, our gratitude to God for his blessings, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:13,Rom12:1-2,1Pet2:5,1Pet2:9-10,1Cor6:20&version=47">[a]</a> and that he may be praised by us; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet2:12,1Pet1:6-7&version=47">[b]</a> also, that every one may be assured in himself of his faith, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Pet1:10,Gal5:6,Gal5:22-23&version=47">[c]</a> by the fruits thereof; and that, by our godly conversation others may be gained to Christ. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet3:1-2,Rom14:19&version=47">[d]</a></p>
<p><a name="q87" title="q87"></a>Q. 87. <b>Cannot they then be saved, who, continuing in their wicked and ungrateful lives, are not converted to God?</b><br />

A. God neither can, nor may be represented by any means: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa40:25&version=47">[a]</a> but as to creatures; though they may be represented, yet God forbids to make, or have any resemblance of them, either in order to worship them or to serve God by them. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Exod23:24-25,Exod34:13-14,Exod34:17,Num33:52,Deut7:5,Deut12:3,Deut16:21,2Kin18:3-4&version=47">[b]</a></p>

A. That we, not only by cursing <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev24:11-16&version=47">[a]</a> or perjury, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev19:12&version=47">[b]</a> but also by rash swearing, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=James5:12&version=47">[c]</a> must not profane or abuse the name of God; nor by silence or connivance be partakers of these horrible sins in others; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev5:1,Prov29:24&version=47">[d]</a> and, briefly, that we use the holy name of God no otherwise than with fear and reverence; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer4:2,Isa45:23&version=47">[e]</a> so that he may be rightly confessed <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:9-10&version=47">[f]</a> and worshipped by us, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps50:15,1Tim2:8&version=47">[g]</a> and be glorified in all our words and works. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom2:24,1Tim6:1,Col3:16-17&version=47">[h]</a></p>

A. It undoubtedly is, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Prov29:24,Lev5:1&version=47">[a]</a> for there is no sin greater or more provoking to God, than the profaning of his name; and therefore he has commanded this sin to be punished with death. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev24:15-16&version=47">[b]</a></p>

A. Yes: either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the glory of God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is founded on God's word, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut6:13,Deut10:20,Isa48:1,Heb6:16&version=47">[a]</a> and therefore was justly used by the saints, both in the Old and New Testament. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen21:24,Gen31:53-54,Jos9:15,Jos9:19,1Sam24:22,2Sam3:35,1Kin1:28-30,Rom1:9,2Cor1:23&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q102" title="q102"></a>Q. 102. <b>May we also swear by saints or any other creatures?</b><br />

A.

A.

<p><a name="q106" title="q106"></a>Q. 106. <b>But this commandment seems only to speak of murder?</b><br />
A. In forbidding murder, God teaches us, that he abhors the causes thereof, such as envy, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Prov14:30,Rom1:29&version=47">[a]</a> hatred, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1John2:9,1John2:11&version=47">[b]</a> anger, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=James1:20,Gal5:19-21&version=47">[c]</a> and desire of revenge; and that he accounts all these as murder. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1John3:15&version=47">[d]</a></p>
<p><a name="q107" title="q107"></a>Q. 107. <b>But is it enough that we do not kill any man in the manner mentioned above?</b><br />
A. No: for when God forbids envy, hatred, and anger, he commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom12:10&version=47">[a]</a> to show patience, peace, meekness, mercy, and all kindness, towards him, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph4:2,Gal6:1-2,Rom12:18,Luke6:36,1Pet3:8,Col3:12,Rom12:10,Rom12:15&version=47">[b]</a> and prevent his hurt as much as in us lies; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Exod23:5&version=47">[c]</a> and that we do good, even to our enemies. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom12:20-21&version=47">[d]</a></p>

<p><a name="q108" title="q108"></a>Q. 108. <b>What does the seventh commandment teach us?</b><br />
A. That all uncleanness is accursed of God: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev18:27-28&version=47">[a]</a> and that therefore we must with all our hearts detest the same, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jude1:23&version=47">[b]</a> and live chastely and temperately, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Thess4:3-5&version=47">[c]</a> whether in holy wedlock, or in single life. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb13:4,1Cor7:7-9,1Cor7:27&version=47">[d]</a></p>
<p><a name="q109" title="q109"></a>Q. 109. <b>Does God forbid in this commandment, only adultery, and such like gross sins?</b><br />
A. Since both our body and soul are temples of the holy Ghost, he commands us to preserve them pure and holy: therefore he forbids all unchaste actions, gestures, words, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph5:3-4,1Cor6:18-20&version=47">[a]</a> thoughts, desires, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a> and whatever can entice men thereto. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph5:18,1Cor15:33&version=47">[c]</a></p>

A. That even the smallest inclination or thought, contrary to any of God's commandments, never rise in our hearts; but that at all times we hate all sin with our whole heart, and delight in all righteousness. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:7&version=47">[a]</a></p>

A.

<p><a name="q115" title="q115"></a>Q. 115. <b>Why will God then have the ten commandments so strictly preached, since no man in this life can keep them?</b><br />

<p><a name="q116" title="q116"></a>Q. 116. <b>Why is prayer necessary for christians?</b><br />
A. Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us: <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps50:14-15&version=47">[a]</a> and also, because God will give his grace and Holy Spirit to those only, who with sincere desires continually ask them of him, and are thankful for them. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke11:9-10,Luke11:13,1Thess5:17&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q117" title="q117"></a>Q. 117. <b>What are the requisites of that prayer, which is acceptable to God, and which he will hear?</b><br />

A. All things necessary for soul and body;  which Christ our Lord has comprised in that prayer he himself has taught us.  James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

<p><a name="q120" title="q120"></a>Q. 120. <b>Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: "Our Father"?</b><br />
A. That immediately, in the very beginning of our prayer, he might excite in us a childlike reverence for, and confidence in God, which are the foundation of our prayer: namely, that God is become our Father in Christ, and will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith, than our parents will refuse us earthly things. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke11:11-13&version=47">[a]</a></p>

<p><a name="q126" title="q126"></a>Q. 126. <b>Which is the fifth petition?</b><br />
A. "And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors"; that is, be pleased for the sake of Christ's blood, not to impute to us poor sinners, our transgressions, nor that depravity, which always cleaves to us; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps51:1-7,Ps143:2,1John2:1-2,Rom8:1&version=47">[a]</a> even as we feel this evidence of thy grace in us, that it is our firm resolution from the heart to forgive our neighbour. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[b]</a></p>

<p><a name="q127" title="q127"></a>Q. 127. <b>Which is the sixth petition?</b><br />
A. "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; that is, since we are so weak in ourselves, that we cannot stand a moment; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps103:14&version=47">[a]</a> and besides this, since our mortal enemies, the devil, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet5:8,Eph6:12&version=47">[b]</a> the world, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=&version=47">[c]</a> and our own flesh, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:23,Gal5:17&version=47">[d]</a> cease not to assault us, do thou therefore preserve and strengthen us by the power of thy Holy Spirit, that we may not be overcome in this spiritual warfare, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark13:33&version=47">[e]</a> but constantly and strenuously may resist our foes, till at last we obtain a complete victory. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Thess3:13,1Thess5:23&version=47">[f]</a></p>
<p><a name="q128" title="q128"></a>Q. 128. <b>How dost thou conclude thy prayer?</b><br />
A. "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever"; that is, all these we ask of thee, because thou, being our King and almighty, art willing and able to give us all good; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:11-12,2Pet2:9&version=47">[a]</a> and all this we pray for, that thereby not we, but thy holy name, may be glorified for ever. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer33:8-9,Ps115:1&version=47">[b]</a></p>
<p><a name="q129" title="q129"></a>Q. 129. <b>What does the word "Amen" signify?</b><br />
A. "Amen" signifies, it shall truly and certainly be: for my prayer is more assuredly heard of God, than I feel in my heart that I desire these things of him. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor1:20,2Tim2:13&version=47">[a]</a></p>
