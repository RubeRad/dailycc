A. Not at all; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph4:24,Eccl7:29&version=47">[a]</a> for God made man capable of performing it; but man, by the instigation of the devil, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor11:3,Gen3:4&version=47">[b]</a> and his own wilful disobedience, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen3:6,Rom5:12,Gen3:13,1Tim2:13-14&version=47">[c]</a> deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.</p><p><a name="q10" title="q10"></a>Q. 10. <b>Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?</b><br />
A. By no means; but is terribly displeased <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen2:17,Rom5:12&version=47">[a]</a> with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally and eternally, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps5:5,Ps50:21,Nah1:2,Exod20:5,Exod34:7,Rom1:18,Eph5:6,Heb9:27&version=47">[b]</a> as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law, to do them." <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut27:26,Gal3:10&version=47">[c]</a></p><p><a name="q11" title="q11"></a>Q. 11. <b>Is not God then also merciful?</b><br />
A. God is indeed merciful, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Exod34:6-7,Exod20:6&version=47">[a]</a> but also just; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps7:9,Exod20:5,Exod23:7,Exod34:7,Ps5:5-6,Nah1:2-3&version=47">[b]</a> therefore his justice requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting punishment of body and soul.</p>
