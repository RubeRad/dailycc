A. Because he saveth us, and delivereth us from our sins; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb7:24-25&version=47">[a]</a> and likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in any other. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts4:12,1Tim2:5,Isa43:11,1John5:11&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q30" title="q30"></a>Q. 30. <b>Do such then believe in Jesus the only Saviour, who seek their salvation and welfare of saints, of themselves, or anywhere else?</b><br />
A. They do not; for though they boast of him in words, yet in deeds they deny Jesus the only deliverer and Saviour; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor1:13,1Cor1:30-31,Gal5:4&version=47">[a]</a> for one of these two things must be true, that either Jesus is not a complete Saviour; or that they, who by a true faith receive this Saviour, must find all things in him necessary to their salvation. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb12:2,Isa9:6,Col1:19-20,Col2:10,1John1:7&version=47">[b]</a></p>
