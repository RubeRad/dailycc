A. That we, not only by cursing <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev24:11-16&version=47">[a]</a> or perjury, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev19:12&version=47">[b]</a> but also by rash swearing, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=James5:12&version=47">[c]</a> must not profane or abuse the name of God; nor by silence or connivance be partakers of these horrible sins in others; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev5:1,Prov29:24&version=47">[d]</a> and, briefly, that we use the holy name of God no otherwise than with fear and reverence; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer4:2,Isa45:23&version=47">[e]</a> so that he may be rightly confessed <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom10:9-10&version=47">[f]</a> and worshipped by us, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps50:15,1Tim2:8&version=47">[g]</a> and be glorified in all our words and works. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom2:24,1Tim6:1,Col3:16-17&version=47">[h]</a></p><p><a name="q100" title="q100"></a>Q. 100. <b>Is then the profaning of God's name, by swearing and cursing, so heinous a sin, that his wrath is kindled against those who do not endeavour, as much as in them lies, to prevent and forbid such cursing and swearing?</b><br />
A. It undoubtedly is, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Prov29:24,Lev5:1&version=47">[a]</a> for there is no sin greater or more provoking to God, than the profaning of his name; and therefore he has commanded this sin to be punished with death. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Lev24:15-16&version=47">[b]</a></p>
