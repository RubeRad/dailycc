A. Thus: That Christ appointed this external washing with water, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt28:19&version=47">[a]</a> adding thereto this promise, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Matt28:19,Acts2:38,Mark16:16,Rom6:3-4&version=47">[b]</a> that I am as certainly washed by his blood and Spirit from all the pollution of my soul, that is, from all my sins, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Pet3:21,Mark1:4,Luke3:3&version=47">[c]</a> as I am washed externally with water, by which the filthiness of the body is commonly washed away.</p><p><a name="q70" title="q70"></a>Q. 70. <b>What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?</b><br />
A. It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely, for the sake of Christ's blood, which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb12:24,1Pet1:2,Rev1:5,Rev7:14,Zech13:1,Ezek36:25&version=47">[a]</a> and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be members of Christ, that so we may more and more die unto sin, and lead holy and unblamable lives. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1Cor6:11,1Cor12:13,Rom6:4,Col2:12&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q71" title="q71"></a>Q. 71. <b>Where has Christ promised us, that he will as certainly wash us by his blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?</b><br />
A. In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed: "Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost", Matt.28:19. And "he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16. This promise is also repeated, where the scripture calls baptism "the washing of regenerations" and the washing away of sins. Tit.3:5, Acts 22:16. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Tit3:5,Acts22:16&version=47">[a]</a></p>
