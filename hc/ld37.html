A. Yes: either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the glory of God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is founded on God's word, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut6:13,Deut10:20,Isa48:1,Heb6:16&version=47">[a]</a> and therefore was justly used by the saints, both in the Old and New Testament. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen21:24,Gen31:53-54,Jos9:15,Jos9:19,1Sam24:22,2Sam3:35,1Kin1:28-30,Rom1:9,2Cor1:23&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q102" title="q102"></a>Q. 102. <b>May we also swear by saints or any other creatures?</b><br />
A. No; for a lawful oath is calling upon God, as the only one who knows the heart, that he will bear witness to the truth, and punish me if I swear falsely; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2Cor1:23,Rom9:1&version=47">[a]</a> which honour is due to no creature. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=James5:12&version=47">[b]</a></p>
