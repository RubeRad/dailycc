A. Because with respect to the justice and truth of God, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen2:17&version=47">[a]</a> satisfaction for our sins could be made no otherwise, than by the death of the Son of God. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom8:3-4,Heb2:9,Heb2:14-15&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q41" title="q41"></a>Q. 41. <b>Why was he also "buried"?</b><br />
A. Thereby to prove that he was really dead. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Luke23:52-53,Acts13:29&version=47">[a]</a></p><p><a name="q42" title="q42"></a>Q. 42. <b>Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?</b><br />
A. Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Mark8:37,Ps49:7&version=47">[a]</a> but only an abolishing of sin, and a passage into eternal life. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom7:24&version=47">[b]</a></p><p><a name="q43" title="q43"></a>Q. 43. <b>What further benefit do we receive from the sacrifice and death of Christ on the cross?</b><br />
A. That by virtue thereof, our old man is crucified, dead and buried with him; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:6&version=47">[a]</a> that so the corrupt inclinations of the flesh may no more reign in us; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom6:6-8,Rom6:11-12,Col2:12&version=47">[b]</a> but that we may offer ourselves unto him a sacrifice of thanksgiving. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom12:1&version=47">[c]</a></p><p><a name="q44" title="q44"></a>Q. 44. <b>Why is there added, "he descended into hell"?</b><br />
A. That in my greatest temptations, I may be assured, and wholly comfort myself in this, that my Lord Jesus Christ, by his inexpressible anguish, pains, terrors, and hellish agonies, in which he was plunged during all his sufferings, <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps18:5-6,Ps116:3,Heb5:7,Isa53:10&version=47">[a]</a> but especially on the cross, has delivered me from the anguish and torments of hell. <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa53:5&version=47">[b]</a></p>
