A. The reasons annexed to the third commandment, in these words, The Lord thy God, and, For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:7&version=47">[617]</a></sup> are, because he is the Lord and our God, therefore his name is not to be profaned, or any way abused by us;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus19:12&version=47">[618]</a></sup> especially because he will be so far from acquitting and sparing the transgressors of this commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgment;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel36:21-23,Deuteronomy28:58-59,Zechariah5:2-4&version=47">[619]</a></sup> albeit many such escape the censures and punishments of men.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Samuel2:12,17,22,24,1Samuel3:13&version=47">[620]</a></sup></p>
