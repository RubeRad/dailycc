A. To pray in the name of Christ is, in obedience to his command, and in confidence on his promises, to ask mercy for his sake;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John14:13-14,John16:24,Daniel9:17&version=47">[1161]</a></sup> not by bare mentioning of his name,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:21&version=47">[1162]</a></sup> but by drawing our encouragement to pray, and our boldness, strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from Christ and his mediation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews4:14-16,1John5:13-15&version=47">[1163]</a></sup></p>
