A. We are to believe that at the last day there shall be a general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts24:15&version=47">[379]</a></sup> when they that are then found alive shall in a moment be changed; and the selfsame bodies of the dead which were laid in the grave, being then again united to their souls forever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians15:51-53,1Thessalonians4:15-17,John5:28-29&version=47">[380]</a></sup> The bodies of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his resurrection as their head, shall be raised in power, spiritual, incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians15:21-23,42-44,Philippians3:21&version=47">[381]</a></sup> and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonour by him, as an offended judge.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John5:27-29,Matthew25:33&version=47">[382]</a></sup></p>

A. At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ's left hand,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:33&version=47">[385]</a></sup> and, upon clear evidence, and full conviction of their own consciences,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans2:15-16&version=47">[386]</a></sup> shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against them;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:41-43&version=47">[387]</a></sup> and thereupon shall be cast out from the favourable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the devil and his angels forever.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke16:26,2Thessalonians1:8-9&version=47">[388]</a></sup></p>
