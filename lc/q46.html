A. The estate of Christ's humiliation was that low condition, wherein he for our sakes, emptying himself of his glory, took upon him the form of a servant, in his conception and birth, life, death, and after his death, until his resurrection.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians2:6-8,Luke1:31,2Corinthians8:9,Acts2:24&version=47">[186]</a></sup></p>
