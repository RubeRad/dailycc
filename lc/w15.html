<p><a name="q66" title="q66"></a>Q. 66. <b>What is that union which the elect have with Christ?</b><br />
A. The union which the elect have with Christ is the work of God's grace,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:22,Ephesians2:6-7&version=47">[270]</a></sup> whereby they are spiritually and mystically, yet really and inseparably, joined to Christ as their head and husband;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians6:17,John10:28,Ephesians5:23,30&version=47">[271]</a></sup> which is done in their effectual calling.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Peter5:10,1Corinthians1:9&version=47">[272]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q67" title="q67"></a>Q. 67. <b>What is effectual calling?</b><br />
A. Effectual calling is the work of God's almighty power and grace,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John5:25,Ephesians1:18-20,2Timothy1:8-9&version=47">[273]</a></sup> whereby (out of his free and special love to his elect, and from nothing in them moving him thereunto)<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus3:4-5,Ephesians2:4-5,7-9,Romans9:11&version=47">[274]</a></sup> he doth, in his accepted time, invite and draw them to Jesus Christ, by his Word and Spirit;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians5:20,2Corinthians6:1-2,John6:44,2Thessalonians2:13-14&version=47">[275]</a></sup> savingly enlightening their minds,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts26:18,1Corinthians2:10,12&version=47">[276]</a></sup> renewing and powerfully determining their wills,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel11:19,Ezekiel36:26-27,John6:45&version=47">[277]</a></sup> so as they (although in themselves dead in sin) are hereby made willing and able freely to answer his call, and to accept and embrace the grace offered and conveyed therein.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians2:5,Philippians2:13,Deuteronomy30:6&version=47">[278]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q68" title="q68"></a>Q. 68. <b>Are the elect only effectually called?</b><br />
A. All the elect, and they only, are effectually called:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts13:48&version=47">[279]</a></sup> although others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the ministry of the Word,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew22:14&version=47">[280]</a></sup> and have some common operations of the Spirit;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:22,Hebrews6:4-6&version=47">[281]</a></sup> who, for their wilful neglect and contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John12:38-40,Acts28:25-27,John6:64-65,Psalm81:11-12&version=47">[282]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q69" title="q69"></a>Q. 69. <b>What is the communion in grace which the members of the invisible church have with Christ?</b><br />
A. The communion in grace which the members of the invisible church have with Christ, is their partaking of the virtue of his mediation, in their justification,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans8:30&version=47">[283]</a></sup> adoption,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:5&version=47">[284]</a></sup> sanctification, and whatever else, in this life, manifests their union with him.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians1:30&version=47">[285]</a></sup></p>
