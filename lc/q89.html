A. At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ's left hand,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:33&version=47">[385]</a></sup> and, upon clear evidence, and full conviction of their own consciences,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans2:15-16&version=47">[386]</a></sup> shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against them;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:41-43&version=47">[387]</a></sup> and thereupon shall be cast out from the favourable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the devil and his angels forever.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke16:26,2Thessalonians1:8-9&version=47">[388]</a></sup></p>
