<p><a name="q70" title="q70"></a>Q. 70. <b>What is justification?</b><br />
A. Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans3:22,24-25,Romans4:5&version=47">[286]</a></sup> in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians5:19,21,Romans3:22,24-25,27-28&version=47">[287]</a></sup> not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus3:5,7,Ephesians1:7&version=47">[288]</a></sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans5:17-19,Romans4:6-8&version=47">[289]</a></sup> and received by faith alone.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts10:43,Galatians2:16,Philippians3:9&version=47">[290]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q71" title="q71"></a>Q. 71. <b>How is justification an act of God's free grace?</b><br />
A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans5:8-10,19&version=47">[291]</a></sup> yet in as much as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Timothy2:5-6,Hebrews10:10,Matthew20:28,Daniel9:24,26,Isaiah53:4-6,10-12,Hebrews7:22,Romans8:32,1Peter1:18-19&version=47">[292]</a></sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians5:21&version=47">[293]</a></sup> and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans3:24-25&version=47">[294]</a></sup> which also is his gift,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians2:8&version=47">[295]</a></sup> their justification is to them of free grace.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:17&version=47">[296]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q72" title="q72"></a>Q. 72. <b>What is justifying faith?</b><br />
A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews10:39&version=47">[297]</a></sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians4:13,Ephesians1:17-19&version=47">[298]</a></sup> and Word of God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans10:14-17&version=47">[299]</a></sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts2:37,Acts16:30,John16:8-9,Romans6:6,Ephesians2:1,Acts4:12&version=47">[300]</a></sup> not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:13&version=47">[301]</a></sup> but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John1:12,Acts16:31,Acts10:43&version=47">[302]</a></sup> and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians3:9,Acts15:11&version=47">[303]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q73" title="q73"></a>Q. 73. <b>How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?</b><br />
A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:11,Romans3:28&version=47">[304]</a></sup> nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans4:5,Romans10:10&version=47">[305]</a></sup> but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John1:12,Philippians3:9,Galatians1:16&version=47">[306]</a></sup></p>
