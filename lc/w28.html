<p><a name="q115" title="q115"></a>Q. 115. <b>Which is the fourth commandment?</b><br />
A. The fourth commandment is, Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested in the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day and hallowed it.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:8-11&version=47">[621]</a></sup>.</p>

A. The fourth commandment requireth of all men the sanctifying or keeping holy to God such set times as he hath appointed in his Word, expressly one whole day in seven; which was the seventh from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian sabbath,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy5:12-14,Genesis2:2-3,1Corinthians16:1-2,Matthew5:17-18,Isaiah56:2,4,6-7&version=47">[622]</a></sup> and in the New Testament called The Lord's day.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation1:10&version=47">[623]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q117" title="q117"></a>Q. 117. <b>How is the sabbath or the Lord's day to be sanctified?</b><br />
A. The sabbath or Lord's day is to be sanctified by an holy resting all the day,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:8,10&version=47">[624]</a></sup> not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but even from such worldly employments and recreations as are on other days lawful;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus16:25-28,Nehemiah13:15-22,Jeremiah17:21-22&version=47">[625]</a></sup> and making it our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it as is to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew12:1-13&version=47">[626]</a></sup>) in the public and private exercises of God's worship:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah58:13,Luke4:16,Acts20:7,1Corinthians16:1-2,Psalm92,Isaiah66:23,Leviticus23:3&version=47">[627]</a></sup> and, to that end, we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight, diligence, and moderation, to dispose and seasonably dispatch our worldly business, that we may be the more free and fit for the duties of that day.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:8,Luke23:54,56,Exodus16:22,25-26,29,Nehemiah13:19&version=47">[628]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q118" title="q118"></a>Q. 118. <b>Why is the charge of keeping the sabbath more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors?</b><br />
A. The charge of keeping the sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:10,Joshua24:15,Nehemiah13:15,17,Jeremiah17:20-22,Exodus23:12&version=47">[629]</a></sup></p>
