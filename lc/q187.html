A. The Lord's Prayer is not only for direction, as a pattern, according to which we are to make other prayers; but may also be used as a prayer, so that it be done with understanding, faith, reverence, and other graces necessary to the right performance of the duty of prayer.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:9,Luke11:2&version=47">[1200]</a></sup></p>
