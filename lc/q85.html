A. The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians15:26,55-57,Hebrews2:15&version=47">[367]</a></sup> so that, although they die, yet it is out of God's love,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah57:1-2,2Kings22:20&version=47">[368]</a></sup> to free them perfectly from sin and misery,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation14:13,Ephesians5:27&version=47">[369]</a></sup> and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke23:43,Philippians1:23&version=47">[370]</a></sup></p>
