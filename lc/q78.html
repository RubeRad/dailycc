<p><a name="q78" title="q78"></a>Q. 78. <b>Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?</b><br />
A. The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans7:18,23,Mark14:66,Galatians2:11-12&version=47">[339]</a></sup> are hindered in all their spiritual services,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews12:1&version=47">[340]</a></sup> and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah64:6,Exodus28:38&version=47">[341]</a></sup></p>
