A. Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out of the visible church, and so strangers from the covenant of promise, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience to him,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts8:36-37,Acts2:38&version=47">[1066]</a></sup> but infants descending from parents, either both, or but one of them, professing faith in Christ, and obedience to him, are in that respect within the covenant, and to be baptized.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis17:7,9,Galatians3:9,14,Colossians2:11-12,Acts2:38-39,Romans4:11-12,1Corinthians7:14,Matthew28:19,Luke18:15-16,Romans11:16&version=47">[1067]</a></sup></p>
