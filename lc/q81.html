A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:13&version=47">[353]</a></sup> true believers may wait long before they obtain it;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah50:10,Psalm88:1-3,6-7,9-10,13-15&version=47">[354]</a></sup> and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm77:1-12,SongofSolomon5:2-3,6,Psalm51:8,12,Psalm31:22,Psalm22:1&version=47">[355]</a></sup> yet they are never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John3:9,Psalm73:15,23,Isaiah54:7-10&version=47">[356]</a></sup></p>
