A. The moral law is of use to all men, to inform them of the holy nature and the will of God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus11:44-45,Leviticus20:7-8,Romans8:12&version=47">[404]</a></sup> and of their duty, binding them to walk accordingly;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah6:8,James2:10-11&version=47">[405]</a></sup> to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution of their nature, hearts, and lives:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm19:11-12,Romans3:20,Romans7:7&version=47">[406]</a></sup> to humble them in the sense of their sin and misery,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans3:9,23&version=47">[407]</a></sup> and thereby help them to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:21-22&version=47">[408]</a></sup> and of the perfection of his obedience.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans10:4&version=47">[409]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q96" title="q96"></a>Q. 96. <b>What particular use is there of the moral law to unregenerate men?</b><br />
A. The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences to flee from wrath to come,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Timothy1:9-10&version=47">[410]</a></sup> and to drive them to Christ;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:24&version=47">[411]</a></sup> or, upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them inexcusable,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans1:20,Romans2:15&version=47">[412]</a></sup> and under the curse thereof.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:10&version=47">[413]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="q98" title="q98"></a>Q. 98. <b>Where is the moral law summarily comprehended?</b><br />
A. The moral law is summarily comprehended in the ten commandments, which were delivered by the voice of God upon Mount Sinai, and written by him in two tables of stone;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy10:4,Exodus34:1-4&version=47">[420]</a></sup> and are recorded in the twentieth chapter of Exodus.
