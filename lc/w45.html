A. The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper agree, in that the author of both is God;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew28:19,1Corinthians11:23&version=47">[1137]</a></sup> the spiritual part of both is Christ and his benefits;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans6:3-4,1Corinthians10:16&version=47">[1138]</a></sup> both are seals of the same covenant,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans4:11,Colossians2:12,Matthew26:27-28&version=47">[1139]</a></sup> are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel, and by none other;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John1:33,Matthew28:19,1Corinthians11:23,1Corinthians4:1,Hebrews5:4&version=47">[1140]</a></sup> and to be continued in the church of Christ until his second coming.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew28:19-20,1Corinthians11:26&version=47">[1141]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q177" title="q177"></a>Q. 177. <b>Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper differ?</b><br />
A. The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper differ, in that baptism is to be administered but once, with water, to be a sign and seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew3:11,Titus3:5,Galatians3:27&version=47">[1142]</a></sup> and that even to infants;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis17:7,9,Acts2:38-39,1Corinthians7:14&version=47">[1143]</a></sup> whereas the Lord's supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians11:23-26&version=47">[1144]</a></sup> and to confirm our continuance and growth in him,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians10:16&version=47">[1145]</a></sup> and that only to such as are of years and ability to examine themselves.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians11:28-29&version=47">[1146]</a></sup></p>
