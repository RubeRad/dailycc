<p><a name="q119" title="q119"></a>Q. 119. <b>What are the sins forbidden in the fourth commandment?</b><br />
A. The sins forbidden in the fourth commandment are, all omissions of the duties required,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel22:26&version=47">[630]</a></sup> all careless, negligent, and unprofitable performing of them, and being weary of them;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts20:7,9,Ezekiel33:30-32,Amos8:5,Malachi1:13&version=47">[631]</a></sup> all profaning the day by idleness, and doing that which is in itself sinful;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel23:38&version=47">[632]</a></sup> and by all needless works, words, and thoughts, about our worldly employments and recreations.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah17:24,27,Isaiah58:13&version=47">[633]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q120" title="q120"></a>Q. 120. <b>What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?</b><br />
A. The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself in these words, Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:9&version=47">[634]</a></sup> from God's challenging a special propriety in that day, The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:10&version=47">[635]</a></sup> from the example of God, who in six days made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it; Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:11&version=47">[636]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q121" title="q121"></a>Q. 121. <b>Why is the word Remember set in the beginning of the fourth commandment?</b><br />
A. The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:8&version=47">[637]</a></sup> partly, because of the great benefit of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus16:23,Luke23:54,56,Mark15:42,Nehemiah13:19&version=47">[638]</a></sup> and, in keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the commandments,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm92,Ezekiel20:12,19-20&version=47">[639]</a></sup> and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation and redemption, which contain a short abridgment of religion;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis2:2-3,Psalm118:22,24,Acts4:10-11,Revelation1:10&version=47">[640]</a></sup> and partly, because we are very ready to forget it,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel22:26&version=47">[641]</a></sup> for that there is less light of nature for it,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah9:14&version=47">[642]</a></sup> and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times lawful;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus34:21&version=47">[643]</a></sup> that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy5:14-15,Amos8:5&version=47">[644]</a></sup> and that Satan with his instruments labours much to blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations1:7,Jeremiah17:21-23,Nehemiah13:15-22&version=47">[645]</a></sup></p>
