A. The needful but much neglected duty of improving our baptism, is to be performed by us all our life long, especially in the time of temptation, and when we are present at the administration of it to others;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians2:11-12,Romans6:4,6,11&version=47">[1068]</a></sup> by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred and sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans6:3-5&version=47">[1069]</a></sup> by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short of, and walking contrary to, the grace of baptism, and our engagements;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians1:11-13,Romans6:2-3&version=47">[1070]</a></sup> by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans4:11-12,1Peter3:21&version=47">[1071]</a></sup> by drawing strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans6:3-5&version=47">[1072]</a></sup> and by endeavoring to live by faith,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:26-27&version=47">[1073]</a></sup> to have our conversation in holiness and righteousness,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans6:22&version=47">[1074]</a></sup> as those that have therein given up their names to Christ;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts2:38&version=47">[1075]</a></sup> and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit into one body.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians12:13,25&version=47">[1076]</a></sup></p>
