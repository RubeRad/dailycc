<p><a name="q77" title="q77"></a>Q. 77. <b>Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?</b><br />
A. Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians6:11,1Corinthians1:30&version=47">[330]</a></sup> yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans4:6,8&version=47">[331]</a></sup> in sanctification of his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel36:27&version=47">[332]</a></sup> in the former, sin is pardoned;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans3:24-25&version=47">[333]</a></sup> in the other, it is subdued:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans6:6,14&version=47">[334]</a></sup> the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans8:33-34&version=47">[335]</a></sup> the other is neither equal in all,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John2:12-14,Hebrews5:12-14&version=47">[336]</a></sup> nor in this life perfect in any,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John1:8,10&version=47">[337]</a></sup> but growing up to perfection.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians7:1,Philippians3:12-14&version=47">[338]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q78" title="q78"></a>Q. 78. <b>Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?</b><br />
A. The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans7:18,23,Mark14:66,Galatians2:11-12&version=47">[339]</a></sup> are hindered in all their spiritual services,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews12:1&version=47">[340]</a></sup> and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah64:6,Exodus28:38&version=47">[341]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q79" title="q79"></a>Q. 79. <b>May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of grace?</b><br />
A. True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah31:3&version=47">[342]</a></sup> and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Timothy2:19,Hebrews13:20-21,2Samuel23:5&version=47">[343]</a></sup> their inseparable union with Christ,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians1:8-9&version=47">[344]</a></sup> his continual intercession for them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews7:25,Luke22:32&version=47">[345]</a></sup> and the Spirit and seed of God abiding in them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John3:9,1John2:27&version=47">[346]</a></sup> can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah32:40,John10:28&version=47">[347]</a></sup> but are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Peter1:5&version=47">[348]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q80" title="q80"></a>Q. 80. <b>Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?</b><br />
A. Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavour to walk in all good conscience before him,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John2:3&version=47">[349]</a></sup> may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians2:12,1John3:14,18-19,21,24,1John4:13,16,Hebrews6:11-12&version=47">[350]</a></sup> and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans8:16&version=47">[351]</a></sup> be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John5:13&version=47">[352]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="q81" title="q81"></a>Q. 81. <b>Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?</b><br />
A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:13&version=47">[353]</a></sup> true believers may wait long before they obtain it;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah50:10,Psalm88:1-3,6-7,9-10,13-15&version=47">[354]</a></sup> and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm77:1-12,SongofSolomon5:2-3,6,Psalm51:8,12,Psalm31:22,Psalm22:1&version=47">[355]</a></sup> yet they are never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John3:9,Psalm73:15,23,Isaiah54:7-10&version=47">[356]</a></sup></p>
