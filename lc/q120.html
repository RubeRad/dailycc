A. The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself in these words, Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:9&version=47">[634]</a></sup> from God's challenging a special propriety in that day, The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:10&version=47">[635]</a></sup> from the example of God, who in six days made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it; Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus20:11&version=47">[636]</a></sup></p>
