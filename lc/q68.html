<p><a name="q68" title="q68"></a>Q. 68. <b>Are the elect only effectually called?</b><br />
A. All the elect, and they only, are effectually called:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts13:48&version=47">[279]</a></sup> although others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the ministry of the Word,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew22:14&version=47">[280]</a></sup> and have some common operations of the Spirit;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:22,Hebrews6:4-6&version=47">[281]</a></sup> who, for their wilful neglect and contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John12:38-40,Acts28:25-27,John6:64-65,Psalm81:11-12&version=47">[282]</a></sup></p>
