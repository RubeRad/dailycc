A. The sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not by any power in themselves, or any virtue derived from the piety or intention of him by whom they are administered, but only by the working of the Holy Ghost, and the blessing of Christ, by whom they are instituted<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Peter3:21,Acts8:13,23,1Corinthians3:6-7,1Corinthians12:13&version=47">[1047]</a></sup>.</p>
