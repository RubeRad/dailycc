A. At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in the clouds,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Thessalonians4:17&version=47">[389]</a></sup> shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged and acquitted,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:33,Matthew10:32&version=47">[390]</a></sup> shall join with him in the judging of reprobate angels and men,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians6:2-3&version=47">[391]</a></sup> and shall be received into heaven,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:34,46&version=47">[392]</a></sup> where they shall be fully and forever freed from all sin and misery;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians5:27,Revelation14:13&version=47">[393]</a></sup> filled with inconceivable joys,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm16:11&version=47">[394]</a></sup> made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints and holy angels,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews12:22-23&version=47">[395]</a></sup> but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to all eternity.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John3:2,1Corinthians13:12,1Thessalonians4:17-18&version=47">[396]</a></sup> And this is the perfect and full communion, which the members of the invisible church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at the resurrection and day of judgment.</p>
