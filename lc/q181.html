<p><a name="q181" title="q181"></a>Q. 181. <b>Why are we to pray in the name of Christ?</b><br />
A. The sinfulness of man, and his distance from God by reason thereof, being so great, as that we can have no access into his presence without a mediator;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John14:6,Isaiah59:2,Ephesians3:12&version=47">[1164]</a></sup> and there being none in heaven or earth appointed to, or fit for, that glorious work but Christ alone,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John6:27,Hebrews7:25-27,1Timothy2:5&version=47">[1165]</a></sup> we are to pray in no other name but his only.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians3:17,Hebrews13:15&version=47">[1166]</a></sup></p>
