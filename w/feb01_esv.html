Wherefore, they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1TH5:9-10,TIT2:14">[76]</a></sup> are effectually called unto faith in Christ by His Spirit working in due season, are justified, adopted, sanctified,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=ROM8:30,EPH1:5,2TH2:13">[77]</a></sup> and kept by His power, through faith, unto salvation.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1PE1:5">[78]</a></sup> Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=JOH17:9,ROM8:28,JOH6:64-65,10:26,8:47,1JO2:19">[79]</a></sup></p>
