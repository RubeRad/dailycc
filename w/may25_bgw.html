A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians3:11,Romans3:28&version=47">[304]</a></sup> nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans4:5,Romans10:10&version=47">[305]</a></sup> but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John1:12,Philippians3:9,Galatians1:16&version=47">[306]</a></sup></p>
