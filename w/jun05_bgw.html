<p align="center"><a name="c16" title="c16"></a>Chapter 16: Of Good Works</p><p><a name="c16p3" title="c16p3"></a>3: Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOH15:4-6,EZE36:26-27&version=47">[316]</a></sup> And that they may be enabled thereunto, beside the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them to will, and to do, of His good pleasure:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHI2:13,4:13,2CO3:5&version=47">[317]</a></sup> yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHI2:12,HEB6:11-12,2PE1:3,5,10-11,ISA64:7,2TI1:6,ACT26:6-7,20-21&version=47">[318]</a></sup></p>
