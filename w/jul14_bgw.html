A. These words before me or before my face, in the first commandment, teach us, that God, who seeth all things, taketh special notice of, and is much displeased with, the sin of having any other God: that so it may be an argument to dissuade from it, and to aggravate it as a most impudent provocation:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel8:5-6,Psalm44:20-21&version=47">[515]</a></sup> as also to persuade us to do as in his sight, whatever we do in his service.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Chronicles28:9&version=47">[516]</a></sup></p>
