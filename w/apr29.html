A. All the elect, and they only, are effectually called:<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=Acts13:48">[279]</a></sup> although others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the ministry of the Word,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=Matthew22:14">[280]</a></sup> and have some common operations of the Spirit;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=Matthew7:22,Hebrews6:4-6">[281]</a></sup> who, for their wilful neglect and contempt of the grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=John12:38-40,Acts28:25-27,John6:64-65,Psalm81:11-12">[282]</a></sup></p>
