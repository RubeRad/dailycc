A. Christ humbled himself in his conception and birth, in that, being from all eternity the Son of God, in the bosom of the Father, he was pleased in the fulness of time to become the son of man, made of a woman of low estate, and to be born of her; with divers circumstances of more than ordinary abasement.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/John1:14,18,Galatians4:4,Luke2:7">[187]</a></sup></p>
