Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1CO11:27-29,2CO6:14-16">[553]</a></sup> or be admitted thereunto.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1CO5:6-7,13,2TH3:6,14-15,MAT7:6">[554]</a></sup></p>
