A. To pray in the name of Christ is, in obedience to his command, and in confidence on his promises, to ask mercy for his sake;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/John14:13-14,John16:24,Daniel9:17">[1161]</a></sup> not by bare mentioning of his name,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Matthew7:21">[1162]</a></sup> but by drawing our encouragement to pray, and our boldness, strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from Christ and his mediation.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Hebrews4:14-16;1John5:13-15">[1163]</a></sup></p>
