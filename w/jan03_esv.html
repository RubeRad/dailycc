A. The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Romans1:19-20,Psalm19:1-3,Acts17:28">[3]</a></sup> but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/1Corinthians2:9-10;2Timothy3:15-17,Isaiah59:21">[4]</a></sup></p>
