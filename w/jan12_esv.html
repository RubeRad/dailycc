<p align="center"><a name="c1" title="c1"></a>Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture</p><p><a name="c1p8" title="c1p8"></a>8: The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/MAT5:18">[17]</a></sup> so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/ISA8:20,ACT15:15,JOH5:39,46">[18]</a></sup> But, because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/JOH5:39">[19]</a></sup> therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/1CO14:6,9,11-12,24,27-28">[20]</a></sup> that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/COL3:16">[21]</a></sup> and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/ROM15:4">[22]</a></sup></p>
