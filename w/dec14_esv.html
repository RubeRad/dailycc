A. The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper differ, in that baptism is to be administered but once, with water, to be a sign and seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Matthew3:11,Titus3:5,Galatians3:27">[1142]</a></sup> and that even to infants;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Genesis17:7,9,Acts2:38-39;1Corinthians7:14">[1143]</a></sup> whereas the Lord's supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/1Corinthians11:23-26">[1144]</a></sup> and to confirm our continuance and growth in him,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/1Corinthians10:16">[1145]</a></sup> and that only to such as are of years and ability to examine themselves.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/1Corinthians11:28-29">[1146]</a></sup></p>
