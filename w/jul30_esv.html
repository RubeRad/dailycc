A. The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Exodus20:8">[637]</a></sup> partly, because of the great benefit of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Exodus16:23,Luke23:54,56,Mark15:42,Nehemiah13:19">[638]</a></sup> and, in keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the commandments,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Psalm92,Ezekiel20:12,19-20">[639]</a></sup> and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation and redemption, which contain a short abridgment of religion;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Genesis2:2-3,Psalm118:22,24,Acts4:10-11,Revelation1:10">[640]</a></sup> and partly, because we are very ready to forget it,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Ezekiel22:26">[641]</a></sup> for that there is less light of nature for it,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Nehemiah9:14">[642]</a></sup> and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times lawful;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Exodus34:21">[643]</a></sup> that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Deuteronomy5:14-15,Amos8:5">[644]</a></sup> and that Satan with his instruments labours much to blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Lamentations1:7,Jeremiah17:21-23,Nehemiah13:15-22">[645]</a></sup></p>
