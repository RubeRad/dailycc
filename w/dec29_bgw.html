For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MAT25:31-46,ROM2:5-6,ROM9:22-23,MAT5:21,ACT3:19,2TH1:7-10&version=47">[576]</a></sup></p>

A. At the day of judgment, the wicked shall be set on Christ's left hand,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:33&version=47">[385]</a></sup> and, upon clear evidence, and full conviction of their own consciences,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans2:15-16&version=47">[386]</a></sup> shall have the fearful but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against them;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew25:41-43&version=47">[387]</a></sup> and thereupon shall be cast out from the favourable presence of God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the devil and his angels forever.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke16:26,2Thessalonians1:8-9&version=47">[388]</a></sup></p>
