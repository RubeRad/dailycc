A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans5:8-10,19&version=47">[291]</a></sup> yet in as much as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Timothy2:5-6,Hebrews10:10,Matthew20:28,Daniel9:24,26,Isaiah53:4-6,10-12,Hebrews7:22,Romans8:32,1Peter1:18-19&version=47">[292]</a></sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Corinthians5:21&version=47">[293]</a></sup> and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans3:24-25&version=47">[294]</a></sup> which also is his gift,<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians2:8&version=47">[295]</a></sup> their justification is to them of free grace.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:17&version=47">[296]</a></sup></p>
