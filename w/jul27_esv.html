A. The charge of keeping the sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/Exodus20:10,Joshua24:15,Nehemiah13:15,17,Jeremiah17:20-22,Exodus23:12">[629]</a></sup></p>
