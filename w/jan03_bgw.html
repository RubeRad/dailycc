A. The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans1:19-20,Psalm19:1-3,Acts17:28&version=47">[3]</a></sup> but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians2:9-10,2Timothy3:15-17,Isaiah59:21&version=47">[4]</a></sup></p>
