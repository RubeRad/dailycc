He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/ROM11:36">[55]</a></sup> and has most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever Himself pleases.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/REV4:11;1TI6:15,DAN4:25,35">[56]</a></sup> In His sight all things are open and manifest,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/HEB4:13">[57]</a></sup> His knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/ROM11:33-34,PSA147:5">[58]</a></sup> so as nothing is to Him contingent, or uncertain.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/ACT15:18,EZE11:5">[59]</a></sup> He is most holy in all His counsels, in all His works, and in all His commands.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/PSA145:17,ROM7:12">[60]</a></sup> To Him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience He is pleased to require of them.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/REV5:12-14">[61]</a></sup></p>
