A. Christ hath appointed the ministers of his Word, in the administration of this sacrament of the Lord's supper, to set apart the bread and wine from common use, by the word of institution, thanksgiving, and prayer; to take and break the bread, and to give both the bread and the wine to the communicants: who are, by the same appointment, to take and eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance that the body of Christ was broken and given, and his blood shed, for them.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1Corinthians11:23-24,Matthew26:26-28,Mark14:22-24,Luke22:19-20">[1083]</a></sup></p>
