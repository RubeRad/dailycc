<p align="center"><a name="c24" title="c24"></a>Chapter 24: Of Marriage and Divorce</p><p><a name="c24p3" title="c24p3"></a>3: It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEB13:4,1TI4:3,1CO7:36-38,GEN24:57&version=47">[478]</a></sup> Yet it is the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1CO7:39&version=47">[479]</a></sup> And therefore such as profess the true reformed religion should not marry with infidels, papists, or other idolaters: neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresies.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN34:14,EXO34:16,DEU7:3-4,1KI11:4,NEH13:25-27,MAL2:11-12,2CO6:14&version=47">[480]</a></sup></p>
