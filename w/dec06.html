<p><a name="q170" title="q170"></a>Q. 170. <b>How do they that worthily communicate in the Lord's supper feed upon the body and blood of Christ therein?</b><br />
A. As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord's supper,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=Acts3:21">[1084]</a></sup> and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly and really than the elements themselves are to their outward senses;<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=Matthew26:26,28">[1085]</a></sup> so they that worthily communicate in the sacrament of the Lord's supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and really,<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1Corinthians11:24-29">[1086]</a></sup> while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.<sup><a href="http://esvonline.org/search?q=1Corinthians10:16">[1087]</a></sup></p>
