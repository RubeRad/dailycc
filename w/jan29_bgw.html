A. God, by an eternal and immutable decree, out of his mere love, for the praise of his glorious grace, to be manifested in due time, hath elected some angels to glory;<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Timothy5:21&version=47">[45]</a></sup> and in Christ hath chosen some men to eternal life, and the means thereof:<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians1:4-6,2Thessalonians2:13-14&version=47">[46]</a></sup> and also, according to his sovereign power, and the unsearchable counsel of his own will, (whereby he extendeth or withholdeth favor as he pleaseth,) hath passed by and foreordained the rest to dishonor and wrath, to be for their sin inflicted, to the praise of the glory of his justice.<sup><a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans9:17-18,21-22,Matthew11:25-26,2Timothy2:20,Jude4,1Peter2:8&version=47">[47]</a></sup></p>
