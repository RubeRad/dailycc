<p align="center"><b><a name="h1" title="h1"></a>The First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching concerning election and reprobation, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h1e1" title="h1e1"></a>I</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the will of God to save those who would believe and persevere in faith and in the obedience of faith is the whole and entire decision of election to salvation, and that nothing else concerning this decision has been revealed in God's Word.
</em></p><p>For they deceive the simple and plainly contradict Holy Scripture in its testimony that God does not only wish to save those who would believe, but that he has also from eternity chosen certain particular people to whom, rather than to others, he would within time grant faith in Christ and perseverance. As Scripture says, I have revealed your name to those whom you gave me (John 17:6). Likewise, All who were appointed for eternal life believed (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts 13:48&version=47">Acts 13:48</a>), and He chose us before the foundation of the world so that we should be holy...
