<p align="center"><b><a name="h2" title="h2"></a>The Second Head of Doctrine: Christ's Death and Human Redemption Through It</b></p><p><b><a name="h2a8" title="h2a8"></a>Article 8: The Saving Effectiveness of Christ's Death</b></p><p>For it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving effectiveness of his Son's costly death should work itself out in all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In other words, it was God's will that Christ through the blood of the cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the Holy Spirit's other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a glorious people, without spot or wrinkle.</p>
<p><b><a name="h2a9" title="h2a9"></a>Article 9: The Fulfillment of God's Plan</b></p><p>This plan, arising out of God's eternal love for his chosen ones, from the beginning of the world to the present time has been powerfully carried out and will also be carried out in the future, the gates of hell seeking vainly to prevail against it. As a result the chosen are gathered into one, all in their own time, and there is always a church of believers founded on Christ's blood, a church which steadfastly loves, persistently worships, and -- here and in all eternity -- praises him as her Savior who laid down his life for her on the cross, as a bridegroom for his bride.</p>
