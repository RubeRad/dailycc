For all his works are known to God from eternity (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Acts 15:18&version=47">Acts 15:18</a>; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 1:11&version=47">Eph. 1:11</a>). In accordance with this decision he graciously softens the hearts, however hard, of his chosen ones and inclines them to believe, but by his just judgment he leaves in their wickedness and hardness of heart those who have not been chosen. And in this especially is disclosed to us his act -- unfathomable, and as merciful as it is just -- of distinguishing between people equally lost. This is the well-known decision of election and reprobation revealed in God's Word. This decision the wicked, impure, and unstable distort to their own ruin, but it provides holy and godly souls with comfort beyond words.</p>
