<p align="center"><b><a name="h34" title="h34"></a>The Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It Occurs</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e8" title="h34e8"></a>VIII</b></p><p><em>Who teach that God in regenerating man does not bring to bear that power of his omnipotence whereby he may powerfully and unfailingly bend man's will to faith and conversion, but that even when God has accomplished all the works of grace which he uses for man's conversion, man nevertheless can, and in actual fact often does, so resist God and the Spirit in their intent and will to regenerate him, that man completely thwarts his own rebirth; and, indeed, that it remains in his own power whether or not to be reborn.
</em></p><p>For this does away with all effective functioning of God's grace in our conversion and subjects the activity of Almighty God to the will of man; it is contrary to the apostles, who teach that we believe by virtue of the effective working of God's mighty strength (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 1:19&version=47">Eph. 1:19</a>), and that God fulfills the undeserved good will of his kindness and the work of faith in us with power (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2 Thess. 1:11&version=47">2 Thess. 1:11</a>), and likewise that his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2 Pet. 1:3&version=47">2 Pet. 1:3</a>).</p>
