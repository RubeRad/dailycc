By this ministry people are called to repentance and faith in Christ crucified. For how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without someone preaching? And how shall they preach unless they have been sent? (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 10:14-15&version=47">Rom. 10:14-15</a>).</p>
<p><b><a name="h1a4" title="h1a4"></a>Article 4: A Twofold Response to the Gospel</b></p><p>God's anger remains on those who do not believe this gospel. But those who do accept it and embrace Jesus the Savior with a true and living faith are delivered through him from God's anger and from destruction, and receive the gift of eternal life.</p>
