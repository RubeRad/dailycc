That is to say, being corrupt he brought forth corrupt children. The corruption spread, by God's just judgment, from Adam to all his descendants --  except for Christ alone -- not by way of imitation (as in former times the Pelagians would have it) but by way of the propagation of his perverted nature.</p>
<p><b><a name="h34a3" title="h34a3"></a>Article 3: Total Inability</b></p><p>Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin; without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit they are neither willing nor able to return to God, to reform their distorted nature, or even to dispose themselves to such reform.</p>
