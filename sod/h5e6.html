<p align="center"><b><a name="h5" title="h5"></a>The Fifth Head of Doctrine: The Perseverance of the Saints</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h5e6" title="h5e6"></a>VI</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the teaching of the assurance of perseverance and of salvation is by its very nature and character an opiate of the flesh and is harmful to godliness, good morals, prayer, and other holy exercises, but that, on the contrary, to have doubt about this is praiseworthy.
</em></p><p>For these people show that they do not know the effective operation of God's grace and the work of the indwelling Holy Spirit, and they contradict the apostle John, who asserts the opposite in plain words: Dear friends, now we are children of God, but what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he is made known, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1 John 3:2-3&version=47">1 John 3:2-3</a>). Moreover, they are refuted by the examples of the saints in both the Old and the New Testament, who though assured of their perseverance and salvation yet were constant in prayer and other exercises of godliness.</p>
