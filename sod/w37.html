<p align="center"><b><a name="h34" title="h34"></a>The Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It Occurs</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e7" title="h34e7"></a>VII</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the grace by which we are converted to God is nothing but a gentle persuasion, or (as others explain it) that the way of God's acting in man's conversion that is most noble and suited to human nature is that which happens by persuasion, and that nothing prevents this grace of moral suasion even by itself from making natural men spiritual; indeed, that God does not produce the assent of the will except in this manner of moral suasion, and that the effectiveness of God's work by which it surpasses the work of Satan consists in the fact that God promises eternal benefits while Satan promises temporal ones.
</em></p><p>For this teaching is entirely Pelagian and contrary to the whole of Scripture, which recognizes besides this persuasion also another, far more effective and divine way in which the Holy Spirit acts in man's conversion. As <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ezekiel 36:26&version=47">Ezekiel 36:26</a> puts it: I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; and I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh....</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e8" title="h34e8"></a>VIII</b></p><p><em>Who teach that God in regenerating man does not bring to bear that power of his omnipotence whereby he may powerfully and unfailingly bend man's will to faith and conversion, but that even when God has accomplished all the works of grace which he uses for man's conversion, man nevertheless can, and in actual fact often does, so resist God and the Spirit in their intent and will to regenerate him, that man completely thwarts his own rebirth; and, indeed, that it remains in his own power whether or not to be reborn.
</em></p><p>For this does away with all effective functioning of God's grace in our conversion and subjects the activity of Almighty God to the will of man; it is contrary to the apostles, who teach that we believe by virtue of the effective working of God's mighty strength (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 1:19&version=47">Eph. 1:19</a>), and that God fulfills the undeserved good will of his kindness and the work of faith in us with power (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2 Thess. 1:11&version=47">2 Thess. 1:11</a>), and likewise that his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2 Pet. 1:3&version=47">2 Pet. 1:3</a>).</p>
