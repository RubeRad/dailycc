<p align="center"><b><a name="h1" title="h1"></a>The First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching concerning election and reprobation, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h1e5" title="h1e5"></a>V</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the incomplete and nonperemptory election of particular persons to salvation occurred on the basis of a foreseen faith, repentance, holiness, and godliness, which has just begun or continued for some time; but that complete and peremptory election occurred on the basis of a foreseen perseverance to the end in faith, repentance, holiness, and godliness. And that this is the gracious and evangelical worthiness, on account of which the one who is chosen is more worthy than the one who is not chosen. And therefore that faith, the obedience of faith, holiness, godliness, and perseverance are not fruits or effects of an unchangeable election to glory, but indispensable conditions and causes, which are prerequisite in those who are to be chosen in the complete election, and which are foreseen as achieved in them.
