<p align="center"><b><a name="h5" title="h5"></a>The Fifth Head of Doctrine: The Perseverance of the Saints</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h5e5" title="h5e5"></a>V</b></p><p><em>Who teach that apart from a special revelation no one can have the assurance of future perseverance in this life.
</em></p><p>For by this teaching the well-founded consolation of true believers in this life is taken away and the doubting of the Romanists is reintroduced into the church. Holy Scripture, however, in many places derives the assurance not from a special and extraordinary revelation but from the marks peculiar to God's children and from God's completely reliable promises. So especially the apostle Paul: Nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 8:39&version=47">Rom. 8:39</a>); and John: They who obey his commands remain in him and he in them. And this is how we know that he remains in us: by the Spirit he gave us (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1 John 3:24&version=47">1 John 3:24</a>).</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h5e6" title="h5e6"></a>VI</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the teaching of the assurance of perseverance and of salvation is by its very nature and character an opiate of the flesh and is harmful to godliness, good morals, prayer, and other holy exercises, but that, on the contrary, to have doubt about this is praiseworthy.
</em></p><p>For these people show that they do not know the effective operation of God's grace and the work of the indwelling Holy Spirit, and they contradict the apostle John, who asserts the opposite in plain words: Dear friends, now we are children of God, but what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he is made known, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1 John 3:2-3&version=47">1 John 3:2-3</a>). Moreover, they are refuted by the examples of the saints in both the Old and the New Testament, who though assured of their perseverance and salvation yet were constant in prayer and other exercises of godliness.</p>
