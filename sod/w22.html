<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h2e4" title="h2e4"></a>IV</b></p><p><em>Who teach that what is involved in the new covenant of grace which God the Father made with men through the intervening of Christ's death is not that we are justified before God and saved through faith, insofar as it accepts Christ's merit, but rather that God, having withdrawn his demand for perfect obedience to the law, counts faith itself, and the imperfect obedience of faith, as perfect obedience to the law, and graciously looks upon this as worthy of the reward of eternal life.
</em></p><p>For they contradict Scripture: They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Jesus Christ, whom God presented as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 3:24-25&version=47">Rom. 3:24-25</a>). And along with the ungodly Socinus, they introduce a new and foreign justification of man before God, against the consensus of the whole church.</p>
