<p><b><a name="h5a2" title="h5a2"></a>Article 2: The Believer's Reaction to Sins of Weakness</b></p><p>Hence daily sins of weakness arise, and blemishes cling to even the best works of God's people, giving them continual cause to humble themselves before God, to flee for refuge to Christ crucified, to put the flesh to death more and more by the Spirit of supplication and by holy exercises of godliness, and to strain toward the goal of perfection, until they are freed from this body of death and reign with the Lamb of God in heaven.</p>
