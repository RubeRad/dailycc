As the apostle says: The whole world is liable to the condemnation of God (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 3:19&version=47">Rom. 3:19</a>), All have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 3:23&version=47">Rom. 3:23</a>), and The wages of sin is death (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 6:23&version=47">Rom. 6:23</a>).</p>
