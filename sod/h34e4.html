<p align="center"><b><a name="h34" title="h34"></a>The Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It Occurs</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e4" title="h34e4"></a>IV</b></p><p><em>Who teach that unregenerate man is not strictly or totally dead in his sins or deprived of all capacity for spiritual good but is able to hunger and thirst for righteousness or life and to offer the sacrifice of a broken and contrite spirit which is pleasing to God.
</em></p><p>For these views are opposed to the plain testimonies of Scripture: You were dead in your transgressions and sins (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 2:1, 5&version=47">Eph. 2:1, 5</a>); The imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil all the time (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gen. 6:5&version=47">Gen. 6:5</a>; 8:21). Besides, to hunger and thirst for deliverance from misery and for life, and to offer God the sacrifice of a broken spirit is characteristic only of the regenerate and of those called blessed (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ps. 51:17&version=47">Ps. 51:17</a>; Matt. 5:6).</p>
