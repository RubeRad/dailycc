<p align="center"><b><a name="h5" title="h5"></a>The Fifth Head of Doctrine: The Perseverance of the Saints</b></p><p><b><a name="h5a9" title="h5a9"></a>Article 9: The Assurance of This Preservation</b></p><p>Concerning this preservation of those chosen to salvation and concerning the perseverance of true believers in faith, believers themselves can and do become assured in accordance with the measure of their faith, by which they firmly believe that they are and always will remain true and living members of the church, and that they have the forgiveness of sins and eternal life.</p>
<p><b><a name="h5a10" title="h5a10"></a>Article 10: The Ground of This Assurance</b></p><p>Accordingly, this assurance does not derive from some private revelation beyond or outside the Word, but from faith in the promises of God which he has very plentifully revealed in his Word for our comfort, from the testimony of the Holy Spirit testifying with our spirit that we are God's children and heirs (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 8:16-17&version=47">Rom. 8:16-17</a>), and finally from a serious and holy pursuit of a clear conscience and of good works. And if God's chosen ones in this world did not have this well-founded comfort that the victory will be theirs and this reliable guarantee of eternal glory, they would be of all people most miserable.</p>
