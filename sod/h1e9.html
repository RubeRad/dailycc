But Jehovah was inclined in his affection to love your ancestors alone, and chose out their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as at this day (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Deut. 10:14-15&version=47">Deut. 10:14-15</a>).

Woe to you, Bethsaida! for if those mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Matt. 11:21).</p>
