For this reason they must constantly watch and pray that they may not be led into temptations. When they fail to do this, not only can they be carried away by the flesh, the world, and Satan into sins, even serious and outrageous ones, but also by God's just permission they sometimes are so carried away -- witness the sad cases, described in Scripture, of David, Peter, and other saints falling into sins.</p>
