Faith in Jesus Christ, however, and salvation through him is a free gift of God. As Scripture says, It is by grace you have been saved, through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is a gift of God (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 2:8&version=47">Eph. 2:8</a>). Likewise: It has been freely given to you to believe in Christ (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Phil. 1:29&version=47">Phil. 1:29</a>).</p>
