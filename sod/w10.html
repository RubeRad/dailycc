<p><b><a name="h1a18" title="h1a18"></a>Article 18: The Proper Attitude Toward Election and Reprobation</b></p><p>To those who complain about this grace of an undeserved election and about the severity of a just reprobation, we reply with the words of the apostle, Who are you, O man, to talk back to God? (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 9:20&version=47">Rom. 9:20</a>), and with the words of our Savior, Have I no right to do what I want with my own? (Matt. 20:15). We, however, with reverent adoration of these secret things, cry out with the apostle: Oh, the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond tracing out! For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Or who has first given to God, that God should repay him? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 11:33-36&version=47">Rom. 11:33-36</a>).</p>
