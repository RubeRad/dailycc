<p align="center"><b><a name="h34" title="h34"></a>The Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It Occurs</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e6" title="h34e6"></a>VI</b></p><p><em>Who teach that in the true conversion of man new qualities, dispositions, or gifts cannot be infused or poured into his will by God, and indeed that the faith [or believing] by which we first come to conversion and from which we receive the name "believers" is not a quality or gift infused by God, but only an act of man, and that it cannot be called a gift except in respect to the power of attaining faith.
</em></p><p>For these views contradict the Holy Scriptures, which testify that God does infuse or pour into our hearts the new qualities of faith, obedience, and the experiencing of his love: I will put my law in their minds, and write it on their hearts (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer. 31:33&version=47">Jer. 31:33</a>); I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa. 44:3&version=47">Isa. 44:3</a>); The love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 5:5&version=47">Rom. 5:5</a>). They also conflict with the continuous practice of the Church, which prays with the prophet: Convert me, Lord, and I shall be converted (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Jer. 31:18&version=47">Jer. 31:18</a>).</p>
