By this ministry people are called to repentance and faith in Christ crucified. For how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without someone preaching? And how shall they preach unless they have been sent? (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 10:14-15&version=47">Rom. 10:14-15</a>).</p>
