</em></p><p>For they contradict the apostle when he says: Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death passed on to all men because all sinned (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 5:12&version=47">Rom. 5:12</a>); also: The guilt followed one sin and brought condemnation (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 5:16&version=47">Rom. 5:16</a>); likewise: The wages of sin is death (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 6:23&version=47">Rom. 6:23</a>).</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h34e2" title="h34e2"></a>II</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the spiritual gifts or the good dispositions and virtues such as goodness, holiness, and righteousness could not have resided in man's will when he was first created, and therefore could not have been separated from the will at the fall.
</em></p><p>For this conflicts with the apostle's description of the image of God in <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Ephesians 4:24,&version=47">Ephesians 4:24,</a> where he portrays the image in terms of righteousness and holiness, which definitely reside in the will.</p>
