</em></p><p>For Holy Scripture testifies that perseverance follows from election and is granted to the chosen by virtue of Christ's death, resurrection, and intercession: The chosen obtained it; the others were hardened (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 11:7&version=47">Rom. 11:7</a>); likewise, He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all -- how will he not, along with him, grant us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died -- more than that, who was raised -- who also sits at the right hand of God, and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 8:32-35&version=47">Rom. 8:32-35</a>).</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h5e2" title="h5e2"></a>II</b></p><p><em>Who teach that God does provide the believer with sufficient strength to persevere and is ready to preserve this strength in him if he performs his duty, but that even with all those things in place which are necessary to persevere in faith and which God is pleased to use to preserve faith, it still always depends on the choice of man's will whether or not he perseveres.
</em></p><p>For this view is obviously Pelagian; and though it intends to make men free it makes them sacrilegious. It is against the enduring consensus of evangelical teaching which takes from man all cause for boasting and ascribes the praise for this benefit only to God's grace. It is also against the testimony of the apostle: It is God who keeps us strong to the end, so that we will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1 Cor. 1:8&version=47">1 Cor. 1:8</a>).</p>
