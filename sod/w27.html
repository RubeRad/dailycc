This is the gospel about the Messiah, through which it has pleased God to save believers, in both the Old and the New Testament.</p>
<p><b><a name="h34a7" title="h34a7"></a>Article 7: God's Freedom in Revealing the Gospel</b></p><p>In the Old Testament, God revealed this secret of his will to a small number; in the New Testament (now without any distinction between peoples) he discloses it to a large number. The reason for this difference must not be ascribed to the greater worth of one nation over another, or to a better use of the light of nature, but to the free good pleasure and undeserved love of God. Therefore, those who receive so much grace, beyond and in spite of all they deserve, ought to acknowledge it with humble and thankful hearts; on the other hand, with the apostle they ought to adore (but certainly not inquisitively search into) the severity and justice of God's judgments on the others, who do not receive this grace.</p>
<p><b><a name="h34a8" title="h34a8"></a>Article 8: The Serious Call of the Gospel</b></p><p>Nevertheless, all who are called through the gospel are called seriously. For seriously and most genuinely God makes known in his Word what is pleasing to him: that those who are called should come to him. Seriously he also promises rest for their souls and eternal life to all who come to him and believe.</p>
