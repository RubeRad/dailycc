<p align="center"><b><a name="h1" title="h1"></a>The First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching concerning election and reprobation, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h1e4" title="h1e4"></a>IV</b></p><p><em>Who teach that in election to faith a prerequisite condition is that man should rightly use the light of nature, be upright, unassuming, humble, and disposed to eternal life, as though election depended to some extent on these factors.
</em></p><p>For this smacks of Pelagius, and it clearly calls into question the words of the apostle: We lived at one time in the passions of our flesh, following the will of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in transgressions, made us alive with Christ, by whose grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with him and seated us with him in heaven in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages we might show the surpassing riches of his grace, according to his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith (and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God) not by works, so that no one can boast (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Eph. 2:3-9&version=47">Eph. 2:3-9</a>).</p>
