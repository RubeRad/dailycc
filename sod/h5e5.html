</em></p><p>For by this teaching the well-founded consolation of true believers in this life is taken away and the doubting of the Romanists is reintroduced into the church. Holy Scripture, however, in many places derives the assurance not from a special and extraordinary revelation but from the marks peculiar to God's children and from God's completely reliable promises. So especially the apostle Paul: Nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 8:39&version=47">Rom. 8:39</a>); and John: They who obey his commands remain in him and he in them. And this is how we know that he remains in us: by the Spirit he gave us (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=1 John 3:24&version=47">1 John 3:24</a>).</p>
