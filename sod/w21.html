<p align="center"><b><a name="h2" title="h2"></a>The Second Head of Doctrine: Christ's Death and Human Redemption Through It</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h2e1" title="h2e1"></a>I</b></p><p><em>Who teach that God the Father appointed his Son to death on the cross without a fixed and definite plan to save anyone by name, so that the necessity, usefulness, and worth of what Christ's death obtained could have stood intact and altogether perfect, complete and whole, even if the redemption that was obtained had never in actual fact been applied to any individual.
</em></p><p>For this assertion is an insult to the wisdom of God the Father and to the merit of Jesus Christ, and it is contrary to Scripture. For the Savior speaks as follows: I lay down my life for the sheep, and I know them (John 10:15, 27). And Isaiah the prophet says concerning the Savior: When he shall make himself an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Isa. 53:10&version=47">Isa. 53:10</a>). Finally, this undermines the article of the creed in which we confess what we believe concerning the Church.</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h2e2" title="h2e2"></a>II</b></p><p><em>Who teach that the purpose of Christ's death was not to establish in actual fact a new covenant of grace by his blood, but only to acquire for the Father the mere right to enter once more into a covenant with men, whether of grace or of works.
</em></p><p>For this conflicts with Scripture, which teaches that Christ has become the guarantee and mediator of a better - that is, a new-covenant (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb. 7:22&version=47">Heb. 7:22</a>; 9:15), and that a will is in force only when someone has died (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Heb. 9:17&version=47">Heb. 9:17</a>).</p>
