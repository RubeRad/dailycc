As a result the chosen are gathered into one, all in their own time, and there is always a church of believers founded on Christ's blood, a church which steadfastly loves, persistently worships, and -- here and in all eternity -- praises him as her Savior who laid down his life for her on the cross, as a bridegroom for his bride.</p>
