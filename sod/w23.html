</em></p><p>For this opinion conflicts with Scripture which asserts that we are by nature children of wrath.</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h2e6" title="h2e6"></a>VI</b></p><p><em>Who make use of the distinction between obtaining and applying in order to instill in the unwary and inexperienced the opinion that God, as far as he is concerned, wished to bestow equally upon all people the benefits which are gained by Christ's death; but that the distinction by which some rather than others come to share in the forgiveness of sins and eternal life depends on their own free choice (which applies itself to the grace offered indiscriminately) but does not depend on the unique gift of mercy which effectively works in them, so that they, rather than others, apply that grace to themselves.
</em></p><p>For, while pretending to set forth this distinction in an acceptable sense, they attempt to give the people the deadly poison of Pelagianism.</p>
<p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h2e7" title="h2e7"></a>VII</b></p><p><em>Who teach that Christ neither could die, nor had to die, nor did die for those whom God so dearly loved and chose to eternal life, since such people do not need the death of Christ.
</em></p><p>For they contradict the apostle, who says: Christ loved me and gave himself up for me (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Gal. 2:20&version=47">Gal. 2:20</a>), and likewise: Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ who died, that is, for them (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=Rom. 8:33-34&version=47">Rom. 8:33-34</a>). They also contradict the Savior, who asserts: I lay down my life for the sheep (John 10:15), and My command is this: Love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends (John 15:12-13).</p>
