<p align="center"><b><a name="h1" title="h1"></a>The First Head of Doctrine: Divine Election and Reprobation</b></p><p>Having set forth the orthodox teaching concerning election and reprobation, the Synod rejects the errors of those</p><p align="center"><b><a name="h1e3" title="h1e3"></a>III</b></p><p><em>Who teach that God's good pleasure and purpose, which Scripture mentions in its teaching of election, does not involve God's choosing certain particular people rather than others, but involves God's choosing, out of all possible conditions (including the works of the law) or out of the whole order of things, the intrinsically unworthy act of faith, as well as the imperfect obedience of faith, to be a condition of salvation; and it involves his graciously wishing to count this as perfect obedience and to look upon it as worthy of the reward of eternal life.
</em></p><p>For by this pernicious error the good pleasure of God and the merit of Christ are robbed of their effectiveness and people are drawn away, by unprofitable inquiries, from the truth of undeserved justification and from the simplicity of the Scriptures. It also gives the lie to these words of the apostle: God called us with a holy calling, not in virtue of works, but in virtue of his own purpose and the grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time (<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage?search=2 Tim. 1:9&version=47">2 Tim. 1:9</a>).</p>
